Pethion&#x27;s life were &#x27;pas-\\nfed in the pracice of the honourable functions of\\nthe lowest class of attornies, or writers; moving\\nin so humble a sphere, his talents were circuin\\nfcribed, and few individuals reaped those benefits\\nfrom his genius which he has lately extended to\\nall his fellow citizens. When Louis XVI. liften-\\ning to the complaints of his fubjeEs, called toge-\\nther the representatives of the people to concert\\nwith them a remedy for their wants, this hypo-\\ncrite, with well managed art, insinuated himself\\ninto the favour of the clergy; and was by their\\ninfluence returned to the firt National Assembly,\\nas member for Chartres. The adder fixed deep\\nhis fting in the bosom that softered him. The un-\\n\\nrelenting\\n\\n(6)\\nrelenting animosity with which he has fanned the\\nexterminating fury of a four years persecution a-\\ngainft this class of citizens, is a flanding monu-\\nment of his gratitude; and the massacre of so ma-\\nny thousands of these unfortunate men, which, du-\\nring this mayorality he connived at, and even so-\\nmented, has inscribed on it, in bloody characters,\\nthe generous qualities of his heart.\\n\\nIn the firt: National Assembly, which contain-\\ned many political luminaries, many individuals of\\nvirtuous principles and sublime genius, Mons. Pe-\\nthion was no ways conspicuous. To raise him-\\nself from the obicurity in which he grovelled, he\\nassumed the charalcer of a violent republican, and\\nassociating himself with Roberfpierre, shone for\\nsome time with a borrowed light. After the\\nKing was flopped at Varennes, and condu&amp;ed\\nback to Paris, this vehement democrate was near-\\nly metamorphosed into a courtier, and he himself\\npointed out to the Court the place of the Mayor\\nof Paris as poffefling sufficient magic to operate\\nthe miracle. But not long after, the moment ar-\\nrived which presented an opportunity, by the em-\\nbracing of which, he could, independent of the\\ncourt, and in opposition to Fayette, who was a can.\\ndidate for the office, feat himself in the place he\\naspired to. The event I allude to, is the division\\nwhich took place in the Jacobin Club, and the\\n\\nsubsequent\\n\\n(7 )\\nsubsequent secession of Mons. Barnave, the Le-\\nmeths, and other leading members.\\n\\nIn consequence of this reparation, Mons. Pethion\\nwas left the ruler of an association of men, who,\\ndeRfitute of property and of character, were pre-\\npared for the execution of any desperate mischief\\nwhich their Cataline should dictate to them. As\\nthe number of aative citizens in this famous club\\ndid not amount to 200o, which was a very small\\nproportion of ioo,ooo, which Paris contains, and\\nwho of course had a right to vote in the eleftion of\\nMayor, the most strenuous exertions of Mons. Pe-\\nthion&#x27;s friends were necessary to effect his purpose;\\nand, in this instance, they gave that demonstration\\nof their zeal and abilities, which, on every future\\noccasion they have manifested. On the first day\\nof the elecion, they difpcrfed chosen bands of fe-\\nditious furies through all the fe&amp;ions, who vocife-\\nrated curses and menaces against any one who\\nlhould vote for Fayette. Many peaceable inha-\\nbitants were intimidated; and out of Ioo,ooo only\\n9500 gave their votes, of which 4000 were for\\nFayette, and 5500 for Pethion.\\n\\nBy these means he was declared Mayor ofPa-\\nris. It may not be amiss to call to the remem-\\nbrance of our readers, that the time which this\\ngreat charater passed in this island, was that which\\nelapsed after he had concerted his measures with\\n\\nhis\\n\\nhis friends in Paris, until this eletion. Du.ing\\nhis residence here, he honoured some gentlemen\\nwith his friendship, and the Revolution Society\\nwith his presence. If this obnoxious planet has\\nleft any infeEtion in this country, I hope the scenes\\nof horror and blood, which, during his reign, have\\nstained France, will operate as an antidote to the\\npoisonous effets of his yifit.\\n\\nFinding himself now Mayor of Paris, he looked\\nforward with exultation to the accomplishment of\\nthe diabolical scheme which his villainy had long\\nmeditated. In the execution of his plan, he pro-\\nceeded with the cool deliberation of the most con-\\nfummate hypocrite. He did not lead the rabble\\nto murder and pillage; but, by conniving at their\\nexcesses, by withholding from plunderers and as-\\nfaffins the rod entrusted to his hands, he raised the\\ninsolence and fury of the mob to the pitch which\\nhe thought necessary for the success of his enter-\\nprise. The first essay he made was on the zoth of\\nlast June ; the horrors of that day are still fresh in\\nthe memory of every one, and my heart would re-\\ncoil at the repetition of them. But the throne\\nhad been polluted, not overthrown. Something\\nwas therefore still wanting to complete the triumph\\nof these enemies of their Sovereign, and the peace\\nof society; and for this purpose Mons. Pethion\\nsummoned the banditties from Marseilles and Brest\\n\\nto\\n\\n( 9\\nto Paris, in dire&amp; opposition to the orders of\\nthe National Aflembly. The eve of the ever-\\nmemorable Ioth of August (an indelible spot in\\nthe page of the history of France&#x27;, the King\\nalarmed at the crowds which surrounded the\\nThuilleries, sent for the trufly guardian of the\\nlaw, and imparted to him his apprehensions; but\\nthe hypocrite assured him he could answer for the\\npeaceable dispositions of the people, and the red\\nfpea they had for the laws. The monarch\\ntranquilized by his assurances, yielded himself to\\nunsuspecting repose, while the traitor, whose\\nduty it was to have watched over it, was mixing\\nthe bitter potion which was next day administered\\nto him. As it is not my intention to write the\\nhiflory of that day, so disgraceful to humanity,. I\\nihall only touch upon the part our hero a&amp;ed in\\nthe fatal tragedy. When the preceding evening\\nhe was ascending to the King&#x27;s apartments, he\\ntold the surrounding mob that he had been sent for\\nas an hostage, and&#x27; that they were not therefore to\\nbe surprised if they did not fee him return. In\\norder that the mischief he had thus set on foot\\nmight work with success, he returned from the\\npalace by a back flair-cafe, and reached-his home\\nuuperceived. The next day,having concerted his\\nplan with Brifibt, Chabot, and Merlin, he permit-\\nted himself to be arrested by another mob, while\\nthe report of his being assassinated by the Swiss\\nGuards was induflrioufly spread among the peo-\\n\\nB ple.\\n\\n( to )\\npie. This manoeuvre answered two purposes; it\\nserved to inflame the mob, and afforded him an\\nexcuse for not attempting to item the overwhelm-\\ning torrent. We confers his ingenuity was al-\\nways great; and we well remember that when\\nthe mob was busy in pillaging a magazine of fu-\\ngar belonging to a merchant in the Fauxbourg St.\\nMarceau, who had voted for La Fayette; this vi-\\ngilant magifirate was employed with the National\\nGuards in the Fauxbourg St. Antoine in feparat-\\ning two men who were quarrelling for a horse,\\nthe property of an ariflocrate. But the day ap-\\nproached to crown his molt sanguine withes. The\\nconducting of an unfortunate monarch and his\\nroyal family to a prison, the exposing them to the\\nimpious derision of a deluded rabble, the power of\\ninsulting fallen greatness, afforded a delicious feast\\nto the ferocious and callous heart of this cruel re-\\npublican. Since the confinement of the royal fa-\\nmily, every outrage which could aggravate the un-\\ncommon cruelty of their lot, every fling which\\ncould add fresh tortures to the poignancy of their\\ndistress, has been applied by their savage jailor.\\nDeprived of their attendants, whose soothing\\nfriendship might brighten the dark scene of adver-\\nfity, confirianed to fix their eyes on the mangled\\nbodies of their massacred friends, we might have\\nimagined that every feeling had been sufficiently\\nput to the rack; but this amiable man suggested\\nnew trials, which his prolific cruel invention de-\\n\\nvised;\\n\\n( I )\\nvised; and the refpe&amp; for the religion of their an-\\nceftors, which the unfortunate royal family enter-\\ntained, was employed as an engine to add to the\\npoignancy of their distress, and to augment the\\n.fum of their misery.\\n\\nB 2 T HE\\n\\nTHE DUKE OF ORLEANS.\\n\\nMONSIEUR L&#x27;EGALITE.\\nAs virtue, when it gilds the humble walks of life,\\nappears more amiable and interesting; so vice ap-\\npears more hideous, from the contrast, when it ful-\\nlies and disgraces elevated flations, History has\\nconsigned many monfers of cruelty and licentious-\\nness to our horror and deteflation: But it was re-\\nserved to our days, to furniih the world with a\\ncharacter on which all the vices of the human\\nheart are heaped, without the shadow of a single\\nvirtue; and this character is to be found in a\\nChristian and civilized country, adding dignity to\\nthe elegant person of Mons. Egalite. A bad son,\\na bad father, a bad husband, a bad friend, a bad ci-\\ntizen, without one virtue of the heart to conciliate\\nour love or esteem; he has neither genius, forti-\\ntude, nor one quality of the mind, to claim our ad-\\nmiration. A debauchee without feeling the pas-\\nsion of love; prodigal without generosity; ambi-\\ntious without courage; the mind revolts from the\\nfight of this horrid carricatura! And yet how in-\\n\\ncomprehensible\\n\\n( &#x27;3 )\\ncomprehensible are the decrees of Providence.\\nThis man had within his grasp, greater bleffirigs\\nthan the most righteous man would dare to ask\\nfor. The cup over-running with happiness and\\ngreatness was presented to his lips, and he daihed\\nit with scorn away. Possessed of riches, which,\\nby relieving struggling worth, would have procur-\\ned him the love and prayers of honesty, he has,\\nby converting them into the means of fedudion,\\nbrought on his head the curses of ruined inno-\\ncence and of weeping parents; enjoying the\\ngreatest power in the State, he might have used its\\ninfluence to have saved his country; in place of\\ndoing so, he meditated and contrived the delfruc-\\ntion of his king, to whose throne his ambition\\nbeckoned him, but from which his pusillanimity\\nrepelled him; united to the most virtuous and\\nmost amiable of women, happiness courted him\\nhome, but he flew from the arms of love and vir-\\ntue to the. embraces of infamy and debauchery;\\nborn to have been beloved, happy, great, and vir-\\ntuous, he chose to be hated, miserable, despised,\\nand criminal.\\n\\nIn the earliest part of his life, he feleaed for his\\nassociates the molt notorious characers of the age\\nfor debauchery and irreligion. He soon outstrip-\\nped them all in the glorious course, and left the\\nmost experienced at a distance. To lead ingenuous\\nyouth from the paths of virtue into the road of\\nwickedness, to triumph in the ruin of innocence,\\nis a refinement on wickedness, which, I imagined,\\n\\ncould\\n\\n{ 4 )\\ncould be gratifying only to the malice of the great\\ntempter of mankind. It was, however, a fatisfac-\\ntion flattering to the ambition, and delightful to\\nthe heart of the Duke of Orleans. Historical jus-\\ntice forces me to unfold a tale, the horror of which\\nharrows my foul. His brother-in law, son to the\\nDuke of Penthievre, was endowed with principles\\nof virtue and religion, which were nourified and\\nstrengthened by the piety and example of his\\nparents. Early in life he was united in wedlock\\nto the late unfortunate Princess de Lamballe; but\\nthe tenderness of their ages did not permit them to\\nlive together. On his demise the great estates he\\nwas to inherit from his father, devolved on the ci-\\ndevant Duc D&#x27;Orleans, in right of his wife. Here\\nthen was an objec worthy the cupidity of this\\nmonster and all his artswere employed, alas, too\\nsuccessfully, to crop this flower ere it blossomed !\\nThe young Prince de Lamballe, not as yet in his\\nfifteenth year, baffled for a time all the allurements\\nof his tempter; but the cruel fiend found him in\\na weak unguarded moment, and presented to his\\npassion the form of beauty. The unhappy youth\\nimbibed, from the charms his generous friend had\\nprocured him, a loathsome distemper: and the\\nfame friend having sent to his assistance his own\\nphysician, the young Prince in a few days fell a\\nviEtim, as was generally imagined, to avarice. The\\ncruel deffiny of a youth universally beloved and\\nesteemed, the tears of a virgin widow, excited the\\ncompafion, and enkindled the indignation of all\\n\\nwho\\n\\n)&#x27;\\nwho were acquainted with the history. Thepoign-\\nards of hired assassins have freed Mons. Egalite\\nfrom the conRfant reproach the unfortunate Prin-\\ncess de Lamballe living offended him with, but the\\nwaters of Lethe cannot wafli out the damned spot.\\n\\nThe implacable hatred which he has manifested\\nagainst his king, and the virulence with which he\\nhas joined the savage persecutors of his queen, are\\nnot to be solely ascribed to his aspiring ambition.\\nWhen the beautiful Marie Antoinette was as yet\\nDauphinefs of France, and fiiining in the splendour\\nof united attractions, our gallant made a proffer\\nto her of his person. Oh, monitrous thought,\\nmore mad than his ambition ! I do not pretend to\\nenter the lifts as the knight of this unfortunate\\nbeauty; but whatever impeachment may be as-\\nfixed on her conjugal fidelity, he rejeEted with\\ncontempt the odious love of this degraded liber-\\ntine; and even reported it to her husband, who\\nupbraided his cousin with his baseness: Hence his\\nresentment; hence his hostility to his sovereign,\\nHaving raised a considerable loan in Holland for\\nthe accomplifiment of his views, it is a matter of\\nnotoriety, that the great Revolution of x789, was\\naided and forwarded by the distribution of his\\ntreasures. The first blow being struck with fuc-\\ncess, he had not the courage to afceud the height\\nhe looked up to with desire, and with envy. If\\nhis cowardice had not been still stronger than his\\nwickedness, I believe there is but little room to\\n\\ndoubt,\\n\\n( 6\\ndoubt, but that France, inflead of being ruled by\\na Convention of Tyrants, would have been go-\\nverned by a single Heliogabalus. But he dared\\nnot what he would; and, on the 6th of Otober\\n1789, when a hired and direEed populace aflfaulted\\nthe palace of Versailles in the dreary hour of night,\\nhe was trembling in disguise, and pointed to the\\nmob the secret passages leading to the apartments\\nof the royal family.\\n\\nThat night would in all probability have proved\\nthe term of the sufferings of Louis and his unfor-\\ntunate family, if the loyalty and valour offome of\\nthe Gardes du Corps had not, by the generous fa-\\ncrifice of their lives, afforded them time to save\\nthemselves from the criminal attempt. This con-\\nfpiracy having proved abortive, from the cowardice\\nof Monsieur Egalitd, he became the objea of in-\\ndignation to all virtuous citizens, and of contempt\\nto those of his own fa&amp;ion. His injured monarch,\\nbefore whose presence he had the impudence to\\nappear, struck him a blow in public; and Mira-\\nbeau, with curses on a man whom he described as\\nalways holding a pistol loaded with crime, and\\ncocked, without daring to pull the triger (D&#x27;Or-\\nleans bande toujours le crime mais il n&#x27;ose pas le\\ntirer) abandoned him to his fordid fate. Ruined\\nin his finances, hated and despised, he fought for\\nshelter in this island: but guilt and shame pursued\\nhim, and the disdain with which he was received\\nby all ranks of people, and even by his former as-\\n\\nfociates,\\n\\n( &#x27;7 )\\nFociates, affords us the consolatory reflection, that\\nthough many errors may have clouded the dawn\\nof a life Britons look to with anxiety, yet the love\\nof virtue is still predominant, and prornmes to cheer\\nand illumine its future course ; it creates in our bo-\\nfoms the comfortable thought, that whatever dif-\\nferencef sentiment or of political views agitates the\\nfenate,.and divides the people, rebellion is univer-\\nsally odious: and that there is a fund of public\\nvirtue and of sense in this nation to baffle the at-\\ntacks of intereited demagogues, and to render vain\\nand impotent the attempts of Englifi or Scots Ja-\\ncobins.\\n\\nThe virtuous daughter of the Duke de Pen-\\nthievre had long suffered in silent grief, the insults\\nwhich a&#x27; man so unworthy of her merits had heap-\\ned upon her; but during the course of lall winter\\nshe was legally separated from him. In the edu-\\ncation of her children Ihe had found some confola-\\ntion in her distresses; but the cruel father tore\\nfrom her embraces a darling daughter, whose com-\\npany enlivened the gloom of her solitude. To add\\ntill more poignancy to the reparation, he sent her\\nto this country, under the care of a certain Ma-\\ndame S.y, the wife of a noted Jacobin, and\\nwho endeavours to inculcate the principles of that\\nclub in the tender bosom of her pupil.

BR. SSOT, known before the Revolution by\\nthe name of Briffot de WaTville, entered upon the\\nstage of public life in England, as the confidant and\\ncompanion of the unfortunate La Motte,who was\\nexecuted during last war as a spy. Fate preserved\\nWarville for more renowned exploits. Absence\\nof mind is a failing incident to men of great ge-\\nnius, and Mons. Briffot was so subjet to it, that he\\nfrequently mitfook his neighbour&#x27;s pockets for\\nhis own. This singularity exposed him to the\\npursuits of the police officers, and obliged him to\\nretire from a country in which, contrary to his\\nprinciples, property is proteaed, and the invaders\\nof it prosecuted. He next visited Switzerland, and\\ncommenced author, by the publication of two ce-\\nlebrated pamphlets, namely, Theorie dzi Vol, and\\nApologie du Vol: Theory of Robbery, and an A-\\npology for Robbery. But wifhfing to reduce his\\ntheory into practice; and not finding the Swiss fa-\\ntisfied with his apology, he quitted a foil, which\\ndid not promise an abundant harvest, and came to\\nParis in the year 1779. Discouraged by the ill\\nsuccess he had met with in the profession he had\\nhitherto followed, he offered his services to Mons.\\n\\nC2 le\\n\\n( 20 )\\nle Noir *, the then minister of the police, and was\\nregistered at his office for a pension of 800 livres\\na-year, as his salary for officiating in the depart-\\nment of a spy, employed by the French govern-\\nment. From the knowledge he had acquired of\\nthe Engliih language, the French minifiry judged\\nhe might be useful to them in America, and sent\\nhim there in this characer. Acquiring, by the re-\\ncommendation he had from several French gentle-\\nmen to their friends, an opportunity of obfervingthe\\ncountry, he published his history of North Ame-\\nrica; a work which, though it contains many\\nfabricated anecdotes of the English, and a false\\nstatement of their army, is not destitute of merit,\\nand is certainly the best of his literary productions.\\n\\nSince\\n* Briffot admits of this fa ; but he will not allow that he\\nreceived this pension as a spy; he fays, it was a fop thrown\\nout to Cerberus, and given to him not to write against govern-\\nment. This, however, does not accord very well with the\\ndescription of the old government, as it seems the cuflorn\\nprevailed, in that time, of rewarding libellers and seditious\\nwriters with a chamber in the Baltile. Wallowing in the\\nopulence acquired by injustice and villainy, Briffot will pro-\\nbably disdain any {hare of the paltry fum of two niillions of\\nlivres, upwards of 80,ooo 1. Sterling, which, on the motion of\\none of the party, was lately voted by the Convention to be\\ndilpofcd of, in rewards and pensions, to be distributed by the\\npresent virtuous minifiry of France. Were such a pension to\\nbe published, what room would there be for the virtuous com-\\nplaining at the rewards heaped upon vice and infamy. Small\\nabuses will exist under the best of governments ; but, alas ! by\\nsuch a change how would abuses multiply !\\n\\n( MI )\\nSince the conclusion of the war, he has p;a i two\\nvisits to England; but the impreflion his talents\\nhad made, not being effaced, and meeting with fe-\\nveral of his acquaintance whose presence was\\ntroublesome to him, his flay here was very short.\\nOn his return to France, government fufpeaing\\nhim to act in the double capacity of spy against\\nFrance as well as for it, furnished him with a\\nlodging for a short time in the Baitile *.\\n\\nIn the year 1788, the period of the disputes be-\\ntween the court and&#x27; the parliament, and of the\\ntroubles in the assembly of the states of Brittany\\nand Dauphiny, he was employed by Monsieur de\\nBrienne, the then prime minister of France, to infi-\\nnuate himself into the confidence of Monsieur Meu-\\nnier, La Fayette, and several other gentlemen fuppof-\\ned to be adverse to the minister. When in Ameri-\\nca he made himself a Quaker, and has ever since\\nasseSed the simplicity of their manners and dress.\\nMonsieur Voltaire, the apostle of the French, hav-\\ning bellowed great eulogiums on this sea, it is\\n&#x27;held in the highest veneration amongot them.\\nAlthough in his incendiary writings, and inflam-\\nmatory speeches, he recommends principles very\\nopposite to the meekness of the Quakers; his as-\\n\\nfumning\\nI n confequcnce of the acquaintance he had with these\\nsaverns of despotism, when the Bastile was taken by the inha-\\nbitants of Paris in July 1789, the keys were delivered to\\nBriffot, that its secret recesses might be explored by his as-\\nfiftance.\\n\\n22 )\\nfaming the title of one, served greatly to promote\\nhis popularity, which originated from the protec-\\ntion of La Fayette, whose friendship he first\\ncourted, and of whose downfal he was one of the\\nmost ative instruments.

I-Ie\\npassed the first years of his life as the clerk of an\\nobscure writer, or low praAitioner of the law, and\\nearned a miserable existence in that line, until the\\nmeeting of the first National Assembly, when, by\\nthe influence of his benefLaor the Biihop of Ar-\\nras, he was returned a deputy for that place. The\\nintendant, or steward of the bishop, supplied him\\nwith what was necessary for his equipment, and for\\nthe expences of his journey to Paris. This vene-\\nrable prelate was assassinated on the 2d of Septem-\\nber 1792, by the bloodhounds of the grateful\\nRoberfpierre.

During\\nthese last two years they have acted in ftrid uni-\\nson, and concerted together the downfal of the\\nmonarchy, and all its attendant crimes which have\\ndisgraced the capital. Mons.

At the commenicemeht of\\nthe Trench Revolution, he returned to Paris, and\\nrecommended himself to the notice of his country-\\nmen, by writing a democratic paper, entitled, but\\nmiscalled, I&#x27;Armi dzu Pei.ple, the fiiend of the\\npeople.

By the recomnenda-\\ntion of the late unfortunate Princess de Lamballe .\\nhe was appointed Miedecin extraordinaire des ecu-\\nries dii Comize d&#x27;lrtois. He was always diftin-\\nguiflied by his cringing to men in power, and in\\ncommon with many of the libellers of the nobility\\nand princes, he was indebted for his existence to\\ntheir countenance and liberality. His profefion-\\nal talents (lid not promise to raise him either too-\\npulence or celebrity; he had the misfortune of\\nlosing so many of his patients, that when any page\\nor domnitic of Comte d&#x27;Artois displeased him,\\nhe was accustomed to threaten him with the visits\\nof Danton. le was so abject in his mode of pay-\\ning his court, that he frequently used to caress and\\nkil&#x27;s the horses, which he said had the happiness to\\nbe the favourites of the Count and Countess d&#x27;Ar-\\ntois; and never did he hear their names pro-\\nnounced, before the 20th of June 1789, without\\ntaking off his hat, as a token of his refpet.

He is possessed of a\\nfine voice and a clear delivery; and though his\\nspeeches are destitute of common sense, he never\\nfails to attract the attention of the populace; as he\\nflatters their pafions, by inveighing against fubor-\\ndination, and exciting them to plunder.

He has been em-\\nployed in that capacity in the several courts of\\nRussia, Poland, Germany, -Holland, and England.\\nMaurepas was the minifler who first noticed his\\ntalents in this line, and who brought them into\\nacion.\\n\\nHe presented him with the brevet of a captain\\nof infan&#x27;ry, in order to facilitate his introdu&#x27;&amp;ion.\\nat the different courts it miglit be necessary to fend\\nhim to. The first important business the captain\\nwas employed in, was the revolt of Pullatfchef\\nagainfl t&#x27;;e Empiefs of Ruflia. He was very ative\\nin fomenting this revolurion, and encouraging with\\nflattering promises its chief; but upon the conc!u-\\nsion of the war wvith the Iurks, when Pugatfciff\\ncould no longer be of service. to the interest of\\nFrance, he was abandoned to his fate. At the be-\\nginning of the reign of the prefenr King of Po-\\nland, and during the arrangement of the p^,rtition\\ntreaty, Monsieur Dumourier was allotted a confi-\\nderable part, and promoted with ability the views\\nof his court. In Poland he assumed various cha-\\nracters, and appeared in the different shapes of an\\nabbe, a friar, and a pilgrin. During the peace-\\nable years of 1777 aud of 1778, our py reiided in\\ndifferent courts of Germany ; and lefL his talents\\nflould grow blunt by inactivity, he kept a watch-\\nful eye on the persons employed by his court, ma-\\nny of whom were disgraced by the reports he made\\nto the miniiter of their minifondut: and inatten-\\ntion.\\n\\nWre\\n\\n( 56 )\\n&quot;1Are remember, though without any sentiments\\nof animosity or revenge, that in the year 1780,\\n-when England was finking under the pressure of\\ne.: many calamities, when struggling abroad with\\n\\n\\u00b7;,i combined nations, and difireffed at home by a\\n,,i violent faCtion and a weak unfortunate adminiftra-\\n\\ntion; in that unhappy time, many French emissaries\\nwere employed in the capital to work the comple.\\ntion of our ruin, by means of intrigue and the dif-\\n| -itribution of money. Monsieur Dumourier was\\nY! ~ ?that year in London, under the name of L&#x27;Abbe\\n\\nSaint Fois, and gave himself out to be a persecuted\\nclergyman, exiled his home for having published a\\nbook intitled, Lafolie de la France d&#x27;ajiter des\\nRebellcs. I cannot tell what were his views, but\\ncertainly the cloth he then wore creates suspicion.\\nAs scenes of confusion and broils seem always to\\nhave attracted him, we find him in the years 1785,\\n1786, and 1787, in Holland, busy in sowing the\\nfeeds of dissention, and adding fuel to rebellion.\\nHe was the confidential counsellor to the Ryhn-\\ngrave of Salm, commander in chief of the patriot\\nforces; and it was, we may suppose, from that\\nrenowned general, that he has itbibed his military\\nliknowledge.\\n\\nIt is a fad worthy of remark, that Monsieur\\nDiumourier was in Amfrerdam on the Iith of\\nOetober 1787, when the duke of Brunswick en-\\ntered that town; who having given orders to have\\nhim arrested, he was then very nigh becoming the\\nduke&#x27;s prisoner. At the termination of the dif-\\n\\nifnfions\\n&#x27;i\\n\\n( 57 )\\nfenfions in &#x27;Holland, to reward hind for his labour,\\nand to afford him a place of retirement, Monsieur\\nDumourier was named by the minister, -Major d .\\nPlace, at Cherbourg. This employment was the\\nheight he arrived to in his military career. His\\nturbulent mind could not long lie dormant; and,\\nin the very commencement of the Revolution in\\nhis own country, it found full scope for his exer-\\ntions; on the first inititution of the society of Ja-\\ncobins at Paris, they sent miflioners into all the\\ntowns through France, to form similar establish.\\nments, which were to correspond with the Comr\\nmittee at Paris, and to co-operate with it, in\\nthe execution of their great designs. Monsieur\\nDumourier became the founder of the club at\\nCherbourg; and to recompense his zeal, the Ja-\\ncobin interest had himnamed a Marechal de Camp.\\nWhen the intrigues and clamours of the Jacobins\\nthrew all France into confusion, by a daily change\\nof ministers, when in the month of lat March the\\nNational Aifembly lent Monsieur de Leffarts to the\\nprison at Orleans; the unfortunate King, a&amp;uated\\nby a wish of refloring tranquillity to his diffraCted\\ncountry, feleeed his ministers from the Jacobin\\nden, and Monsieur Dumourier was appointed mi,\\nnifter for the foreign department.\\n\\nBy the advice of this council, Lewis declared\\nwar against his nephew the present Emperor of\\nGermany. I shall not pretend to discuss the justice\\nor injustice, the policy or impolicy of this war;\\nbut my reader will permit me one remark, which\\n\\nH- will,\\n\\n( 8\\nwill, I hope, be found consonant to truth and reas\\nson. At the moment Lewis announced to the\\nNational Assembly his intention to declare war a-\\n.&#x27;:&quot;&#x27; gainft the King of Hungary, this declaration was\\n, ,&#x27; received with re-echoed lapplaufe, and Lewis\\n\\nwas greeted with the title of King of the People.\\nIf;i - When the nation was plunged in the war itself so-\\nj~i ~ licited, when blood was spilt, then the Jacobin\\nI!, ~ faction became clamorous with rebellion, and\\n\\nbranded the unfortunate monarch as a traitor and\\n;iu rebel. Monsieur Dumourier, the adviser and infti-\\n?:&#x27; . gator of this war, is crowned with civic honours,\\n\\nEnd ~ and raised to the chief command. His sovereign\\n\\nis loaded with chains, and this war forms one of\\nthe articles of accusation againit this unfortunate\\nAIt n monarch.\\n\\nA dispute betwixt our hero and some of his as.\\nfociates, who might imagine themselves deprived\\nof a due (hare of the spoils, has lately arisen ; and it\\nremains to be the subjea of discussion in the vir-\\ntuous Senate of France, whether her renowned\\ncommander shall be permitted to dilapidate the\\npublic treasures, and to plunder his fellow citizens,\\nU r~! &#x27;in the charater of a contracor for the army, at\\n\\nthe fame time that he, and the other victorious\\n:;| - generals of the Republic, are, under the polluted\\n\\nbanners of Liberty, carrying the horrors, which\\n:[ ; 1ji would attend an irruption of Barbarians, into those\\n: in~&#x27; !unfortunate countries, where injustice, lawless vio-\\n\\nlence, and exulting vice are made to reign tri-\\numphant ?\\n\\n-&#x27;IJ .A MER.\\n1.i .\\n\\nMERLIN.\\nThough last not least.\\n-FEAR not, gentle Merlin, that any ignoble senti-\\nment shall induce me to hide your merits from the\\nworld; fear not, that I shall permit your civic\\nactions to be buried in oblivion.

Merlin, was born at Thionville; and be-\\ning destined for an ecclesiastic, he assumed and\\nwore for some time, the dress of an Abbe. But\\nhis dispositions were very opposite to those necef-\\nfary for a clerical fiate, and some youthful frolics\\nhaving exposed him to the danger of being sent to\\na house of correction, he made a precipitate re-\\ntreat from his father&#x27;s mansion ; and fled to Paris.\\nDestitute of money and resources, he was reduced\\nto misery i and to support hinfelf, he entered in the\\ncapacity of an under ufler into a school in the\\nFauxbourg of St. Antoine. He passed three years\\nin obscure drudgery, but becoming weary of his\\n\\nH 2 situation,\\n\\n,i\\n\\n;q! \\u00a2 ~( 6o )\\n? situation, he endeavoured to work upon the good-\\n\\n[&#x27;|s ~ ness of his father, and solicited his permiflion to\\ni: return to Thionville. The indulgent parent re-\\n\\nceived his prodigal, and proposed to establish him,\\nby marrying him to the only child of a wealthy\\ncitizen. Young Merlin consented; but the charms\\nof the young lady&#x27;s person not having the fame in-\\nfluence upon his heart as those of her portion, he\\nwished to enjoy the one free from all incumbrance,\\ni&#x27;~ ~ and on the eve of the day appointed for the wed-\\n\\nding, he disappeared with his bride&#x27;s dower, leaving\\nthe forlorn maiden to weep over his treachery, and\\nhis father to refund 30,000 livres. He now made\\nhis appearance at the German Spa; and, flufied\\nwith cafli, was a welcome visitor to the dealers of\\njL!i * Faro. He had lately deceived a fair virginj; and\\n\\nFortune, to revenge insulted Hymen, completely\\n:I jilted him in his courtihip to her. In a few weeks\\n\\nhll his louis d&#x27;ors funk in the vortex- of Faro. He\\n&#x27;:,~i. was lodged at Spa. at the hotel die Loup, known\\n.it,;!&#x27; to many of my countrymen, for the goodness of\\n\\nits cook, the civility of its hostess, and the charms\\nof her fair daughters. The chamber next to his,\\nwas inhabited by a Dutch lady, Madame la Ba-\\ni: |&#x27; ronne de Van der Berg; and Mons. Merlin\\n\\nthought that Dutch ducats might prove very good\\nsubstitutes for French livres. One morning, there-\\ni;j\\u00a7 |fore, when the Baronnefs had gone to dine at\\n:it Ch-aude Fontaine, about twenty miles from Spa,\\n\\n;S Si he broke open the door of her apartment, and paid\\nI;;! ~a visit to her strong box, which was not so well\\n:l^~il~\\n~7 -furniihed.\\niis~~~~~~~\\n\\n( 6x )\\nfurnished as he expe&amp;ted. - Sixty pitiful lou:s d;o-r\\nwere all the contents; he, however, had too\\nmuch humility to despise, and pocketing hii, dif-\\nappointment, he borrowed a horle in order to take\\na illort ride; but, changing his mind, he extended\\nit to France.\\n\\nHe first went to Nancy, where not meeting with\\nthe owner of the horse, he fold it ; his ity at Nan-\\ncy was but ihort, and he paid a second visit to the\\ngreat and gay capital. His slender finances were\\nsoon e::haufted by riot and diflipation; and, reduc-\\ned once more into the abyss of want, he looked\\nwith a longing eye to thc peaceable dwelling of\\nhis father. The feelings of the parent were\\nawakened by the tears of distress; and he restored\\nhis affleion to young Merlin, on condition of his\\nespousing the lady he had before proposed for him,\\nwho having the good nature to forgive his former\\ncondut, the nuptials were immediately celebrated.\\nHe passed some years without affording to the bi-\\nographer any at of notoriety; nor did he appear\\non the political flage until the second National\\nAssembly, to which he was returned a member,\\nThe Jacobin club discovered his merits, and plac-\\ned him among the elec7; and he has worked with\\nzeal and assiduity to promote their schemes. It\\nwould require the eloquence of a Gibbon, to ren-\\nder justice to his patriotism; I ought to borrow the\\nanimated pen of a Robertson, to record the heroic\\nvirtue which he displayed in November 179 ,\\nwhen, deaf to every feeling but that of patriotifmn,\\n\\nhbe\\n\\n( )\\nhe denounced, as a feuilant, his aged parent, whofd\\nindulgence and mercy he had so often experienceds\\nand made a motion for his accusation. The Na-.\\ntional Assembly, listening, we suppose, to vulgar\\nprejudices, refused to pass the decree; but the Ja-\\ncobins singled out this pious son, as a person the.\\nbell qualified to open the bloody business they\\nwished to execute. He acquitted himself of his\\ntalk with ability, and even though in his attempt\\non his sovereign&#x27;s life, he {hould not meet with\\nmore success than he experienced in the one on his\\nfather&#x27;s; we do justice to his intention, and in the\\nlifts of parricides and regicides, Merlin&#x27;s name\\nshall be enrolled with distinguished honour.\\nSemper bonos, nomenque tuumr laidefque manc-\\n\\nbunt.\\nE~~~it. .:~ .~CO.\\ni:\\n\\nCONCLUSIO N.\\niT is not from want of time or materials, or from\\nindolence of temper, that 1 have reduced the his.\\ntorical fietches of the men of this day in France\\nto their twelve apostles; I thought that men so\\ngloriously distinguished, merited the honour of be-\\ning represented in one frame.
