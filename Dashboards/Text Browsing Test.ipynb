II. B attends\\n\\nattends it, is no essential part of the disease,\\nnor ever requires any particular attention,\\nbut always goes off by the common treat-\\nment, with the other symptoms. The pain\\nin the head also, although pretty acute in\\nthe beginning, soon subsides after the third\\npurge, and is not attended with that degree\\nof fulness or repletion in the head, which\\nprevents the patients from moving their\\nbody, and is one of the pathognomonic\\nsymptoms of the atrabilious fever in the\\nperipneumonic habits.\\n\\nAfter a single bleeding, vomiting, and\\nproper purging for a certain number of\\nday\\u00a7, according to the degree of the fever\\nand habit of the sick, the yellow bilious fe-\\nver comes to cotion and crisis by kindly\\nperspiration during the night season, and\\nfinishes in a few days afterwards; whereas\\nthis species of atrabilious fever, after the\\nfame bleeding, vomiting, and purging,\\ncomes to a peculiar species of co&amp;ion and\\ncrisis, viz. a spitting of gross matter from\\nthe lungs; which frequently lasts forty\\ndays, according to the observation of Hip-\\npocrates, before the lungs are purged, and\\nthe whole habit depurated.\\nPeripneu- The true atrabilious fever then, when\\nthonihno. complicated with peripneumony, has every\\nrateriftic symptom already mentioned in the yellow\\nfymp:om. bilious fever; to which is superadded, first,\\n\\nA remarkable smallness and softness of the\\n\\npulse:\\n\\npulse: secondly, A degree of repletion in\\nthe head, which endangers an apoplexy on\\nviolent or quick motion: Thirdly, a diffi-\\nculty of breathing, and frequently a wheez-\\ning noise in respiration, peculiar to this\\nfever, and seldom accompanied with any\\nacute or feated pain: fourthly, Then comes\\non a dry, hard, tearing cough: and, fifthly,\\nAn expectoration of tough phlegm, at first\\nropy and white, but at last soft and yellow,\\nas often as the principal part of the crisis\\ncomes by the lungs.\\n\\nThese are the five pathognomonic fymp.\\ntoms of this fever, which distinguish it from\\nevery other disease. I have looked over\\nthe ancients for it in vain; suppose their\\nmanner of living, and the climates of Ara-\\nbia and Greece did not favour it; however,\\nthey could not help observing in general,\\n&quot;Obefi plerumque, acutis morbis, cum difi-\\n&quot; cultate fpirandi, Jirangulantur; fubitoque\\n&quot;f epe moriuntur: quod in corpore enuiore\\n&quot;vix evenit.&quot; Compare with Hippocra-\\ntes, fed. ii. Aph. art. 44.\\n\\nBut let us now enumerate the fads, Pipneu-\\nand trace the natural rife and progress of h, its ori\\nthis complaint, as the surest means to form gin&#x27;\\na just idea of it. In the high and southern\\nparts of Europe, it is scarcely formed; in\\nthe hot climates never: but it is frequent\\nin Normandy, Slanders, Holland, Britain,\\nand Ireland; where the pasture-lands are\\n\\nB rich,\\n\\nrich, cattle and poultry highly fed, where\\nthe people indulge in eating fat and butter,\\nand drink fermented liquors, or debauch in\\nspirits. Sydenham thought that brandy\\nwas the sole cause of it; and therefore\\nproposed, that it hould be absolutely pro-\\nhibited except among the surgeons, aid\\nthere confined to external application only.\\nPerineu- We meet every day with people who\\nmonia no-\\nh. habit pant and wheeze, with a bloated face, yel-\\no liable low, prominent eyes, fhort-neck, big-belly,\\n\\nflow soft pulse, cool hand, fair skin, and\\ngood appetite, without any sign of spasm,\\ntickling pain or cough, but a perpetual\\noppression on the breath, if they but walk\\na little, and a frequent, vain endeavour to\\nbring up a tough, insipid pituite, that\\nseems to fluff every gland. In general,\\nthese persons take little exercise, eat a great\\ndeal of animal food, fat and butter; their\\nmeat is plainly roafled or boiled ; or&#x27;.rather\\nhalf roafled or half boiled; they drink\\nnothing but fermented liquors, except a\\nlittle tea morning and evening, and take\\na reasonable quantity of sleep: they are\\nwarm in bed, but hardly ever sweat, be-\\ncause the vessels are prefied by the fat in\\nthe cellular membrane, and the skin is di-\\nftended; so that nothing can escape easily\\nthat way ; but a thin volatile exhalation,\\nwhile all the gross oils are retained, and\\nperhaps united with, and coagulated by\\n\\nthe\\n\\nthe auflere acid of their drink, which also\\nabounds in all animal fat, particularly\\nthat called tallow. This union is not only\\nknown to all our chymifts, but also to our\\ntallow-chandlcrs, who convert the thinner\\nfat to dry tallow by the help of mineral\\nacids.\\n\\nIn hot climates, where the skin is much Perpneu\\n\\nmonia no-\\nrelaxed, and the juices greatly exalted, thistha,notfre-\\ncan hardly be the cafe; nor indeed is the ciI:eS.ht\\nmeat o loaded with fat; and their ripe\\nfruit yields a more soapy acid: but in our\\ncountry and climate, an oily, viscid lentor\\nmay easily be contraced, and frequently\\ncontinue for a long time, without any signs\\nof much acrid or aive principles, and\\nmen frequently die suddenly of a perip-\\nneumonia notha, after eating a hearty din-\\nner, without any appearance of a former\\nindisposition *.\\n\\nThus\\n* These are the people who are mofi liable to fud-\\nden death, and one species of apoplexy; as Sydenham\\nhas observed of peripneumonic habits; and give rife\\nto what has been called Facies Apopletlica.\\n\\nThe writers of systems have divided the apoplexy\\ninto three kinds; it, Thecephalica, arising from great\\ndistention or rupture of the blood veftels of the brain;\\nor ome comprefflon on that organ. 2dly, The\\ncardiaca, supposed to proceed from dilatation, rupture,\\nor obftru6tion in ome of the blood veflels of the heart\\nand pericardium. And 3dly, The Jomachica, said to\\ncome from crude and turgid collections in the stomach\\nand bowels,\\n\\n3 I have\\n\\nPeripneu- Thus we have an idea of the terrentzck\\nmonia no-\\ntha, its firfiorbi, to prevent the dangerous confe-\\nstage. quences\\n\\nI have had many opportunities of infpeeing the\\nbodies of people who have died of apoplexies. In the\\nyear 1747, I saw one instance in a journeyman car-\\npentor, where there seemed to be much blood extra-\\nvalated iound the cerebellum, which ran down all along\\nthe meduwla pinalis: and this is the only initance I ever\\nmet with of the cephalica.\\n\\nNot long after, a gentleman of Edinburgh, who\\nhad been many years fubje&amp; to an uncommon pain in\\nthe region of the heart, which obliged him to bleed\\ntoties quoties; had negleaed his usual bleeding too\\nlong, and dropt down dead playing on the violin.\\nBeing opened, part cf one of the large veflels near the\\nheart was found very thin, and a finall aperture in it,\\nthrough which the blood flowed, so as to fill the peri-\\ncardium: the fame has been seen from a polypus in\\nthese vessels.\\n\\nIt is evident therefore, that there are such apoplexies\\nas the cephalica and cardiaca. But by far the greater\\nnumber of such as I have infpet6ed, did not appear to\\nhave died from these causes; for,-upon the most firid\\nexamination, the morbid appearances were no other\\nthan great difiention of the stomach and bowels; and\\nthat distention of the veins which is common in all\\nsubje&amp;s who die without loss of blood or being much\\nreduced: These seem to have perished in the first ri-\\ngor of a fever fuperindured in a contfitution such as is\\nhere described : where Nature being greatly opprefled\\nby repletion and obftrufion, the relaxed veffuls were\\nunable to perform their functions, and the party died\\nbefore the fever was able to develope itself.\\n\\nAccording to this idea one that dies in the cold fit\\nof an ague, peripneumonia notha, or caufus biliofus, may\\nbe said to die apoplectic; which can hardly happen in\\na true caufus infamtmatorius, because this always pre-\\nfuppofcs clastic solids, and frong vital powers. But\\n\\nif\\n\\nquences of which, such a reformation of\\nregimen is necessary as few people will\\n\\nconform\\nif there should be a great degree of plethora ad vires,\\nthe rigor may be so considerable as to bring on an\\napoplexy, and the person may perish in the cold fit or\\nfirst access of a fever of the inflammatory kind.\\n\\nTo explain this matter I will give a short account\\nof a few cafes, out of a great number, by which it\\nwill appear, that many people, who are suddenly de-\\nprived of sense and motion, die for want of proper\\nassistance in the first attack of a common fever: and\\nthat the means frequently used to restore them, may\\noften prevent their recovery.\\n\\nSome years ago, in the month of July, I happened\\nto be at a gentleman&#x27;s house in Hertfordshire; a ser-\\nvant came in a great hurry to tell me that the coach-\\nman had dropt down dead in the stable; I ran to the\\nplace, and there I saw a sout, lusty, young man in\\na true apoplexy: his pulse beat about 40 in a minute,\\nvery soft and large; his breathing was deep, and the\\nexpiration so long, that each seemed his last: his\\nhands and face were cold ; his mouth remained either\\nopen or (hut, as it was placed; his eyes were open ;\\nand the pupils much dilated: but if the eyelids were\\nbrought over the balls they remained closed; info-\\nmuch that one eye might be shut nearly, and the other\\nleft more open than is natural. He had stript off his\\ncoat and waiflcoat, and undone his shirt collar, be-\\nfore.\\n\\nHere then was a true apoplexy, to cure which I\\nopened a vein, which bled freely without any liga-\\nture: at first I thought the pulle mended ; but after\\nthe loss of eight ounces, I perceived the pulse rather\\nmore soft; upon which tied up the arm.\\n\\nI then felt about his stomach and belly, which were\\nvery greatly diifended, and wished that 1 might be able\\nto make him vomit; with this intention 1 pufled a\\nfcather down his throat; and prelently there came up\\n\\nB 4. omni\\n\\nconform to, till by an interrupted perfpi-&quot;\\nration, or some other accident, the lentor\\nsome wind and froth ; oon after he began to reach,\\nand pulled away my hand with a force which I could\\nnot resist: I made the servants hold him fast, while I\\ncontinued to irritate the pharynx with the feather;\\nafter some efforts, he brought up a prodigious quan-\\ntity of frothy phlegm; when he had emptied his fto-\\nmach, he began to look about, and complained of a\\nmost violent pain in the right temple and all that fide\\nof the head and face. I then ordered him a strong\\ndole of salts and manna, and he was quite well the\\nnext day.\\n\\nUpon enquiry, I was informed, that this young man\\nhad been hard at work, and had heated himself very\\nmuch; in this situation he had gone down into a cold\\ncellar, where he drank a quantity of new small beer,\\nand was jufc returned to his work when he dropt\\ndown.\\n\\nThis apoplexy then may be called vera Jomnachica,\\nand could not have been removed by bleeding, blisters,\\ncauteries, volatiles, nor alcalies. I have seen some-\\nthing of the fame kind frequently in the cold fit of\\nquartan agucs; when the patient seemed reduced to\\nthe last cxtremity, a reaching and even vomiting has\\ncome on, which soon abated the degree of the rigor.\\n\\nTalking of this cafe to my worthy friend Dotor\\nArmfirong, he told me, That once when at dinner in\\na tavern at Greenwich, the landlord came running\\ninto the room, and enquired if there was ever a fur-\\neon in the company to bleed a man who had dropt\\nown apoplcaic at the bar: the good doaor, with his\\nusual humanity, ran&#x27; down flairs, and found an exte-\\nnuated old man suddenly deprived of sense and mo-\\ntion; he opened his mouth, and got down a glass of\\nbrandy by flow degrees: the consequence was, that\\nthe man belched up a great deal of wind, and soon\\n\\nrecovered.\\n\\nfs rendered more acrid; a degree of fever\\nthen comes on, with a degree of cold, hor-\\n\\nror,\\nrecovered. Here then was a cafe in which bleeding\\nmight have been detrimental.\\n\\nIn the beginning of February 1772, during the\\natrabilious constitution, when the winter fever and\\nperipneumonia notha were quite epidemic, I was called\\nto fee a lady aged about 40. I was told that he had\\nbeen very delicate, and subjet tonervous complaints;\\nthat within two years he was become remarkably\\nlusty. Upon examination, I saw the pupils of both\\neyes violently dilated, but the eyeballs quite yellow;\\nher extremities were cold, and pulse about 38 in a\\nminute, soft and very small; the breathing was very\\nflow, weak, and irregular; just as he was dropping\\nfrom her chair, he complained of a sudden pain in her\\nright temple.\\n\\nBefore I. saw her he had loft about fix or seven\\nounces of blood, which was of a very yellow colour,\\nand not fizy: volatiles and flimulants had been tried\\nto no purpose. I endeavoured to make her vomit with\\na feather, and succeeded in some degree; every time\\nthe reached, the pulse mended; I then got down a\\nfirong vomit by&#x27;degrees; had her put into bed, and\\ndirected a clyster to be injeaed very warm; and blad-\\nders filled with hot water to be laid all round her in\\nbed.\\n\\nAlthough I confidered this apoplexy to be no other\\nthan the rigor and first access of the epidemic fever;\\nand foretold the hot skin, quick pulse, and foul tongue,\\nwhich were to follow; yet, because this fever was for\\nthe most part accompanied with a fluxion of tenacious\\nmatter on the lungs, I direced a blister to be put be-\\ntwcen the fhouldcrs, and sinapisms to each foot, with-\\nout waiting for the effect of the vomit and clyfler;\\nboth which I hoped might operate before the blisters\\ncould take place,\\n\\n* ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~tv\\n\\nror, and rigor; a difficult breathing, anct\\ntickling dry cough.\\n\\nThis\\nIf the vomiting or purging did not come on in an\\nhour, I dire6ced the warm clyster to be repeated; in\\nthe mean time I desired that he should not be fatigued&#x27;\\nwith constant turning and teasing her; but be suffered\\nto remain-quiet, and wait fix hours for the effec of\\nthe medicines.\\n\\nAfter fix hours I returned, and found that the vomit\\nhad operated twice moderately, and that he had had\\none flool soon after; the pulse was now more steady,\\nbut soft, and about 70 in a minute; he had recovered\\nher natural warmth, and was able to speak and fwal-\\nlow. I then ordered a little purging draught, and\\ndireEted thin, subacid liquors to be given frequently\\nwith a little wine. But as the heat and pulse were so\\nmoderate, I did not remove the blifler nor inapifms.\\n\\nThe next morning ihe complained much of the pain\\nin her head, and great inclination to doze: the kin\\nwas hot; pulse an hundred, soft and equal: the tongue\\nwas very foul, and the urinejumentofa. I ordered the\\nblister and sinapisms to be removed, and to increase the\\nquantity of orange juice in all her sippings: I directed\\na purging apozem to be given regularly till a purging\\nshould come on, and in short to treat the whole com-\\nplaint as a bilious fever; which had the desired effeta\\nfor after the purge had operated, the pain of the head\\ngradually subsided; and the left arm and leg, which\\nat one time seemed paralitic, soon recovered their na-\\ntural warmth and motion; only the pulse remained\\nmore small and irregular in that fide for 24 hours.\\nAll the stools were bilious for ome days, and con.\\nflantly gave relief.\\n\\nThis cafe was evidently more bilious than inflam-\\nmatory; however as the pulse became a little tight on\\nthe third day, a few ounces of blood were taken away\\nby cups, applied to the neck and shoulders, at the\\nfame time that the body was kept open.\\n\\nBut\\n\\nThis is the first sage of the formed fe-\\nver, and gives name to the disease; because\\n\\nit\\nBut after the season of the true inflammation I have\\nseen the cafe varied considerably, of which I will give\\none instance.\\n\\nA lady, aged about 70 years, who had been liable\\nwhen young to hamoptfis; but after the age of thirty\\nyears became very hedlthy, strong, and lusty. About\\nseven years ago she was seized with an eryfipelatous\\nfever, which ran so high as to require large and re-\\npeated bleeding; after which the ever yielded to fre-\\nquent gentle purges, and a cooling diet; but the\\nfluxion was so acrid and violent on one leg as to re-\\nquire the attendance of a surgeon for forty days: after\\nwhich he recovered her usual health and appetite.\\n\\nThree years ago she met with a good deal of vexa-\\ntion, which brought on a depreflion of pirits, and at\\nlast, a dangerous, atrabilious fever. After the fever\\nwas carried off, she neglected taking her former exer-\\ncife, and did not pay proper attention to little com-\\nplaints that came now and then.\\n\\nPlaying at cards one evening, in the month of\\nMarch, at a friend&#x27;s house, he dropt from her chair\\nin a kind of fit, and was deprived of sense and motion.\\nA surgeon was sent for, who took away 12 ounces of\\nblood; which gave such immediate relief, that she was\\ncarried home in a coach to her own house: I saw her\\nfirst at night, and he spoke to me with her usual good\\nsense and good humour.\\n\\nHer kin was temperate, pulse very flow, large and\\nsoft; her tongue was. white; eyes yellow, and the\\npupils dilated; her body was tense, diflended, and\\ncofhve. I ordered a cupful of purging ptisan to be\\ntaken every hour till he hould have three stools.\\n\\nThe next morning I found that the whole ptisan\\nhad operated only twice; the pulle was become full\\nand hard, and about oo in a minute; the eyes were\\ninflamed, and the head much affected; I ordered her\\n\\n2 to\\n\\nit does, in some degree, resemble the true\\nperipneumony; and in some people, at\\n\\ncertain\\nto be blooded, and he loft 12 ounces before the pulse\\naltered: the purging ptisan was repeated. This blood\\nwas yellow and very fizy. She had some reft at night\\nafter the operation of the purge, and seemed better\\nthe morning of the third day; but in the evening the\\npulse became very violent, and the fever returned; the\\nbleeding was again repeated to 12 ounces, and a purg-\\ning clyfier was adminiflered.\\n\\nUpon the fourth day the fever subsided, and the\\nurine was hypoftatic: the inflammation of the eyes\\nwas gone off; and he spoke quite sensibly; but the\\nfeatures of the face were distorted and drawn towards\\nthe right fide, and the whole left fide was paralitic;\\nthe pulse was about go, still very large, and regular;\\nbut not hard: and Ihe complained of great pain in the\\nhind part of the head, down the left fide of the neck,\\narm and back.\\n\\nUpon the fifth day he loft 8 ounces of blood by\\ncups on the neck and pained parts; and was again\\npurged more briskly than before. At night a blister\\nwas put to the back, and the day following he be-\\ngan to take the deobftruent gums with a decotion of\\naperient roots, &amp;c. which he continued for many\\nmonths, and recovered gradually. Now, I look upon\\nthis cafe to be more inflammatory than bilious.\\n\\nI have heard objections made to bleeding, because of\\nthe old age of a patient; but without reason, for\\nsome old people are liable to high inflammation, and\\nin such cafes the rigidity of their fibres increases the\\ndisease.\\n\\nAn old navy surgeon, who had been many years on\\nthe superannuated lift, was seized with an apoplexy,\\nand was relieved by a plentiful bleeding; an high in-\\nflammatory fever succeeded, and his life was saved by\\nrepeated bleeding and an antiphlogistic treatment.

In the beginning, the pulse is weak, soft,\\ntha, cauteofand small, and the head is full and giddy,\\nthe fymp- because the lungs are so infarCed, and all\\n\\nthe viscera of the abdomen so obftruced,\\nthat the circulation is impeded, and the\\nblood is almost tagnated in the head; at\\nthe fame time the urine is intensely red,\\nor rather of an orange colour, as is com-\\nmon in all the bilious and atrabilious\\ndiseases; the thick sediment, of course, is\\nlateritious, but not at all critical; it only\\nindicates the surcharge of the atrabilious\\nlentor, and therefore is no very good omen.\\nAfter the first bleeding, and after the\\npurging has been perlifted in till the bow-\\nels are unloaded, and a considerable quan-\\ntity of the atrabilious lentor has been eva-\\ncuated, then the urine becomes more clear,\\nand much less loaded, at the fame time that\\nthe head is relieved considerably: the\\nurine then remains crude till the expec-\\ntoration begins, when it again becomes\\nmore thick, and prognosticates cocdion with\\nthe other symptoms, arising at this period\\nof the distemper, viz. a moist slain an\\nopen body.\\n\\n3 Whc\\n\\nWhen Sydenham first met with this Pepneu.\\ndisease, he very naturally concluded thattha &#x27;hy\\nit was inflammatory, and consequently at-sydenha&#x27;,\\ntempted to condut it by an&#x27;antiphlogiific\\ntreatment: but his natural sagacity soon\\ntaught him to discover his error; accord-\\ningly, he used, in this distemper, the fame\\nmethod and regimen which had been found\\nso salutary in the bilious fever, and fuc-\\nceeded to his wish; and indeed, if the\\nperipneumonia notha is taken in time, none\\nelse will be required, as has been said in\\n&#x27;the winter fever; but if things are ne-\\ngleted in the beginning, and the fluffing\\nof the lungs is suffered to remain a confi-\\nderable time, they cannot be cleared by\\npurging downwards, as the ancients have\\nvery well observed ; but they must require\\napurgation upwards, that is, by expedo-\\nration; so that a stated and confirmed pe- Peripneu.\\nripneiumonia notha may be divided into two thar.&#x27;p.\\narts; of which the firfl may be called the raring tn&#x27;lc\\nrude and obflrucd slate, which requires a\\nourfe of deobftruents and purgatives down-\\nards till the bowels are cleared, and the\\ntra bilis evacuated; uppofe from nine to\\nourteen days, according to the circum-\\nances of each individual, and of the power\\nf the regimen and medicines employed:\\nnd, secondly, The concoced and filppurat-\\nng state, when the whole remainder of the\\nomplaint is fixed in the lungs, and requires\\n\\nC 2 a pur-\\n\\na purgation upwards by expectoration;\\nduring which second stage, all evacuations\\nmuff be forborn, that are known by experi-\\nence to retard expectoration; and such only\\ncan be of service as we are sure promote it.\\nThus the fame bleeding, and even the\\npurging, which were of such singular\\nservice in the beginning, would now be-\\ncome highly detrimental, inasmuch as\\nbleeding flops expectoration, and purging\\nretards it; after the spitting, therefore,\\ntakes place, we muff not bleed, even if\\nthe pulse should rife ever so much; nor\\nmust we do any more by purging remedies,\\nthan perhaps to keep the body regular by\\na seasonable clyster, pro re nata: but our\\nwhole attention muff be to the degree and\\nquality of the matter expecorated; that is,\\nto forward it by little, gentle, frequent\\npukes; to render it fluid when too tenacious\\nby dilution; warm seams taken down by\\nrespiration, so as to foment the lungs; and\\nall the medicines that are called detergent\\nfor the lungs, such as squills, antimonials,\\nhoney, and oxymel; vinegar whey, &amp;c. ar\\nproper, not forgetting blisters, which are of\\nmore service in this than in any other fe-\\nver, when applied at a proper period of the\\ndisease, to attenuate the morbid lentor, and\\npromote the expecoration of it.\\nP opineuo By such means the pitting may be kept\\ntha, prai. up to the proper degree, and by it a crisis\\ncal onbeva . obtaine\\ntins nit. obtained\\n\\nobtained on or before the fourteenth day,\\nsooner or later, according to the idiofincrafy,\\nand other circumfiances of the sick, obferv-\\ning carefully two things: firfr, The more\\nyellow and thin the expecorated matter\\nis, the more acid and purging are required;\\nand, on the contrary, in all cafes where\\nacids are indicated, animal food is perni-\\ncious, or, at least, not indicated, and bread,\\nbarley, or rice gruel, with honey, vinegar,\\nand a little wine, will support the strength\\nbetter than fish or flesh meats; but when\\nthe matter becomes white and concoced,\\nthen broths may be granted; and so by\\ndegrees the vituals and drink may be\\nmended gradually, as the disease subsides;\\nand the body suffered to become more\\ncotlive.\\n\\nBut, secondly, We mufl not forget, that Peripneu.\\nas a certain degree of expectoration is tha,praa-\\nrequired, and as this intention mull be cl admoni.\\npromoted to a certain degree, both by di-\\nluents, attenuants, stimulants, stupes, blift-\\ners, pukes, and warm liquors; so it is very\\npotfible to carry this regimen and course of\\nmedicine too far; and consequently bring\\non an expectoration of crude matter; which\\nerror I have frequently seen: the effe is\\nthis, a new fever comes on, with fresh fymp-\\ntoms of crudity; and the spitting, although\\nin great quantity, does not seem to empty\\nthe lungs; four ounces of concolced matter,\\n\\nC 3 in\\n\\nin the course of twenty-four hours, will\\nrelieve the breathing more than any quan-\\ntity of such thin crude phlegm can do.\\n\\nIt is therefore highly necessary, that,\\nas oon as the foregoing medicines have\\nhad the desired effed, we forbear persist\\ning in them, unless they hould again b\\nrequired; and that we content ourfelve\\nwith simple warm diluents, and soft pedo\\nrals, so long as the matter continues of\\nproper colour, consistency, and quantity\\nwaiting patiently till Nature has had tim\\nto perform her work, now happily begun\\nThis very material part of the cure is t\\nbe onduted chiefly by varying the drink\\nand diet, according to the degree of th\\ntenacity or fluidity of the expectorate\\nmatter;

SHALL now draw, into a more com-\\n\\nprehenfive view, an account of the\\nseveral diseases which are produced by, and\\npartake of the reigning contfitutions which\\nsucceed each other in the circle of the year,\\ntheir various complications with each other,\\nand the different intentions of cure. This\\nis the more necessary, as I am conscious\\nthat, in the situation in which I wrote, I\\ncould not keep so itrialy to method, as\\nmight be expected; and was obliged to\\nhave recourse to frequent digressions. I was\\nunwilling, that some observations, which\\nI had great reason to think of importance,\\nshould lie dormant in my own mind, till\\nI could reduce them into a system; which,\\nhowever, may, perhaps, hereafter be done:\\nI therefore committed them to writing as\\nthey occurred, during the short and inter-\\nrupted intervals of business; and I have\\nnow laid them before the public from the\\nfame motives. If my little work ihall be\\nfound to contain ufefuil knowledge, 1 am\\nnot very solicitous about the manner in\\nwhich it is conveyed. For the unavoid-\\n\\nable\\n\\nable repetitions in this recapitulation, I\\nihall make no apology.\\n\\nAll fevers are, for some days, preceded Fevers in\\nby several little complaints, which were call- general\\ned by the Greek physicians QpoSepo, which\\nCelfus translates terrentia morbi, the har-\\nbingers of the fever. These are fucceede\\nby a degree of rigor, which is the begin-\\nning of thejlated fever, and marks the first\\nday of it in the journal. The quick pulse,\\ndry mouth, hot kin, and other febrile\\nsymptoms follow: these increase gradually\\nfor some days, and at length get into a re-\\ngular train; so that something of the fame\\nfort happens every day nearly at the fame\\nhour, for some days, without any sensible\\nalteration. During this period, much mif-\\nchief is done by ignorant people, who,\\nnot confidering that Nature is at work to\\ndigest the morbid matter, and prepare it\\nfor expulsion, are very officious by heat-\\ning at one time, cooling at another; now\\nraising the fever too high, then lowering\\nit too much; running first one way and\\nthen another, like a person in a labyrinth,\\nimpelled by a blind desire to get out, with-\\nout knowing the right trad. When Na-\\nture has had sufficient time to prepare the\\nmatter for expulsion, and to expel the\\ngreater part of it, all or moss of the fymp-\\ntoms sulfide gradually, till the difea&#x27;e de-\\nserves the name of a fever no longer; but\\n\\nfill\\n\\nflill some complaints remain, which are\\nthe consequences of the fever, or in com-\\nmon language, the dregs of it: here, again,\\nignorant people are over-officious, by pro-\\ncuring such violent evacuations as reduce\\nthe natural powers, and retard the perfect\\nrecovery.\\nFever, the Every fever may be divided into the fol-\\nit.s\\u00b0 lowing periods: the harbingers, the begin-\\n\\nning, the increase, the state, the decline,\\nand the consequence: and each of these\\nmay have different degrees, both of vio-\\nlence and duration, according to the na-\\nture of the fever; for each species of fever\\nhas a nature peculiar to itself, in confe-\\nquence of which, it goes through its pe-\\nriods with greater or less velocity than\\nothers- it is therefore necessary to acquire\\na particular knowledge of each species, so as\\nto distinguish the fever in question from all\\nothers, and to determine the duration of\\nits periods.\\nFevers divi. To communicate what I know of this\\ntwobctrs. matter, I have divided all fevers into two\\n\\nclasses: the first I call common fevers; be-\\ncause they happen regularly every year,\\nand seem to be the natural production of\\nthis climate, and of the manner in which\\nwe have lived for at least these last twenty\\nyears. The second I call uncommon or\\npestilential fevers; bcaufe they are not\\nthe constant and. natural prodution of our\\n\\nclimate,\\n\\nclimate, but are either of foreign import-\\nation, or the necessary consequence of some\\nextraordinary combination, and produced\\nin a goal-or hospital, by bad water, bad\\nprovisions, or some other cause, co-operat-\\ning with the climate, and usual manner of\\nlife.\\n\\nThese fevers are generally contagious Fevers com-\\n\\nmo ae in\\nwhich the common fevers are not, except numbe,\\ntheir nature is altered, and they are rendered e:&quot;&#x27;\\nmalignant by bad treatment. In each of the\\ncommon fevers there is a great variety of\\nsymptoms arising from the variety offeafons\\nand weather; frorf idiolincrafy, and other\\ncircumstances of the sick. These various\\nsymptoms have given rife to the great va-\\nriety of names by which fevers have been\\ndistinguished; for, after all my reading,\\nand all my experience, I think the com-\\nmon fevers may be reduced to seven fpe-\\ncies, classes, or conflitutions; and as they\\narise from the season of the year, mufl as-\\nset many at the fame time, confequently&#x27;be\\nepidemic, viz. The inflammatory, catarrh-\\nous, humoral, putrid, bilious, atrabilious,,\\nand intermittent.\\n\\ni. The inflammatory fever, or fever from Fever in.\\nfizy blood, which I have ventured to call,,t. &quot; &#x27;\\nKauo-0;, or ardent, or burning hot, if left to\\nNature, always terminates by the form-\\nation of pus in the vessels, which is after-\\nwards evacuated by the common emundo-\\n\\nVOL. II, D ries,\\n\\nties, if in . moderate quantity, and is what\\nforms the most perfe&amp;t -&#x27;rotCro-s in the\\nurine. But if the quantity is very con\\nfiderable, and the progress of the fever\\nrapid, then phlegmons are formed, or\\ncertain deposits, to which Nature direds\\nsome part of the pus, and there evacuates\\nit by an ulcer upon some of the external\\nor internal surfaces of the body, which\\nco-operates with the hypoftafis in the\\nurine, &amp;c.\\n\\nAs ulcers are frequently formed in or\\nnear vital organs, whose funcions they\\nmay destroy, it is better to prevent this\\nformation of phlegmons, and, early in the\\ndisease, to evacuate the offending matter,\\nby the open orifice of the vein, (as Syden-\\nham calls it) without waiting for cotion\\nand expulsion; of the success of which\\nexpedient, I have seen numberless in-\\nstances.\\n\\nThis fever may be produced in vigorous,\\nhealthy people, young or old, at any fear\\nson of the year, particularly in high and\\ndry countries, where the people live much\\non bread and vegetables; but it is most\\nfrequent in this city, from Christmas to the,\\nmonth of June inclusive; that is, after\\nthe winter cold has subsisted long enough\\nto brace the solids and condense the fluids\\nof our bodies; and therefore, the most\\ngenuine inflammations, as well as the molt\\n\\n&#x27;.. &#x27; &#x27; &#x27; &#x27; &#x27; &#x27; &#x27;v io le n t,\\n\\n, .\\n\\nviolent, happen in the months of Febru-\\nary and March; particularly if the baro-\\nmeter is high, and the wind blows from\\nany point between north-west and east;\\nconsequently, all fevers of what species so-\\never, which happen between Chriimas and\\nJune, will be complicated with inflam-\\nmation more or less, according to the idio-\\nfincrafy, and other circumstances, and will\\nrequire an antiphlogistic treatment in pro-\\nportion. Hence we find, that the ca-\\ntarrhous fever, and the humoral fever,\\nboth happening during there five months,\\nare partly inflammatory, and yield, in a\\ngreat measure, to the antiphlogistic regi-\\nmen; nay, are sometimes cured by it,\\nand always exasperated by an opposite\\ntreatment.\\n\\n2. The humoral fever, or jynochus non Fever hu.\\npuItris of the ancients, which Sydenham ychusr\\ncalls the most frequent of all fevers, the &quot;\\u00b01 Putris&#x27;\\ngreat fever of Nature, or the depuratoryh\\nfever, may happen at different seasons of\\nthe year in ome particular constitutions;\\nbut we do not meet with it often till the\\nday lengthens considerably, and the spring\\nor vegetation is far advanced. Betides the\\ninflammation which this fever has in com-\\nmon with the former fever, there is a\\nfluxion of tough phlegm, which Nature\\ndeposites upon the stomach and bowels at\\nthis feabon, which mutt be evacuated; so\\n\\nD that\\n\\nthat after the inflammatory part of the\\ncomplaint is partly conquered by bleeding\\nand cooling diet, the matter contained in\\nthe stomach and bowels must be evacuated\\nas often as the symptoms of turgidity in\\neither denote its existence.\\n\\nThis will often remove the whole ail-\\nment; but sometimes part of the morbid\\nmatter may remain, which requires a longer\\ndigestion in the vessels, and will not pass\\noff properly, by any other outlet than the\\nskin. There is indeed scarce any of the\\ncommon fevers, in which kindly moderate\\nsweats are, through the whole course, more\\nbeneficial; but if these sweats are promoted,\\nbefore the fizinefs of the blood is subdued,\\nthe inflammation will be exasperated; and\\nif, before the turgid matter in the bowels is\\nevacuated, the quantity of morbid matter\\nwill be attenuated and exalted; then reab-\\nsorbed, and mixed with the blood, so as to\\nbring on an irregular, dangerous, and mili.\\nary fever, which, if the patient lives long\\nenough, frequently terminates in a very bad\\nkind of dysentery.\\n\\nThis fever remits almost from the be.\\nginning, and if properly treated, the re.\\nmission becomes daily longer and longer,\\ntill at last it comes to a real intermiflion\\nor the disease goes quite off: it therefore\\ngreatly resembles ome forts of the spring\\n\\nauci\\n\\nague; and all the spring fluxes partake of\\nits nature.\\n\\nWhen the fluxion of tough phlegm falls\\nupon the bowels without a purging or con-\\nfiderable degree of fever, it occasions indi-\\ngeflion and obftru&amp;ion, obstinate conftipa-\\ntion, dry belly-ach, or jaundice, according\\nto the idiofincrafy of each individual: all\\nthere disorders are very frequent at this sea-\\nson, and having a similar cause with the\\nfever, are cured nearly by the fame means,\\nas daily experience hews.\\n\\n3. The other great spring complaint, is Fever ca.\\nthe catarrh, or a fluxion of thin acrid rheum what.\\non the membrana Sneideri and lungs, at-\\ntended with sneezing, coryza, angina, and.\\ncough. With refped to this fever also,\\ntwo things are to be confidered; first, The\\ndegree of inflammation, and then the\\nquantity and acrimony of the fluxion:\\nthis fever seldom happens before Christ-\\nmas, most commonly in February, and\\ngives rife to the true consumption, or\\nphthbiis of the lung ; it is of a tedious\\nnature, and frequently lasts to the end of\\nJune: during its course, it is ometimes\\ncomplicated with the humoral fever, and\\nrelieved by the fame vomits and purges\\nnecessary for that fever; but when single,\\nit has its natural crisis, chiefly by expeto-\\nration: nor does it require repeated vomits\\nand purges, except there hould be evident\\n\\n1 3 signs\\n\\nsigns of turgid matter in the stomach or\\nbowels.\\n\\nBut the luxion of morbid matter upon\\nthe embrana Sneideri, which happens in\\nthis fever, is not a true phlegmon that\\ndischarges pus; but rather resembles a\\nphlegmonoides, which discharges a thin,\\nacrid lymph; for which reason, perhaps, it\\nhas been found in some degree malignant\\nand contagious to young people.\\nFever c When a true peripneumony comes, after\\ntarrhou ,\\ndifferent coEion, to a plentiful spitting, the fever sub-\\nfrom a true\\np.ro&quot;na fides every day, and the patient spits a thick,\\ntmot. white, laudable pus, plain or fireaked with\\n\\nblood, like that from the burtling of an im-\\npofthume; but in the catarrh, after frequent\\nblccding,, and a cooling regimen, there\\ncomes on a vast dilcharge from the lungs\\nand fauces, of a clear,.acrid pituite, fretting\\nand tickling wherever it touches, and the\\nquickncfs of the pulse continues, notwith-\\nltanding the great discharge from the parts\\naffeced; lo that acrimony seems to have a\\nconiiderable share in this fever, and there-\\nlorc many of those who are most subjet to\\nit, are alib ubjc&amp;a to heats, pimples, and\\ntetters uylon the skin, previous to the pul-\\nmonary complaint, and the return of these\\ncruptions i a sign of recovery; many\\nhave brought on a catarrl by endeavouring\\nto remove them. And here let me observe,\\nthat if a firing eryfilclas in a young pcr-\\n\\nson\\n\\nson be repelled, a catatrh will also probably\\nfollow; whereas a dysentery, for the molt\\npart, will be the consequence of repelling\\nan erysipelas in harvest.\\n\\nTo conduct the catarrhs during the\\nviolence of the inflammation, besides the\\ncommon evacuations, the molt thin diet is\\nrequired; such as the juice of ripe fruit;\\nbarley-water, infusions of bread, of apples.\\nand the like; but when the hardness of the\\npulse is abated, soft food, of the more\\nnourishing kind, succeeds better such as\\ncucumbers, lettice, all kinds of feeds, graini\\nbread, sweet roots, dry fruits, rennet-\\nwhey, and butter-milk. I have sometimes\\nthought, that the bad practice, which does\\nso much mischief in this disease, was owing\\nto a notion&#x27; that it was of the fame nature\\nwith the peripneumonia notha of the month\\nof November; or rather with that cough\\nand fever which Sydenham calls the win-\\nter fever.\\n\\nIgnorant people having observcd the Fever c-\\ngreat advantage of blisters in these com-diferent\\nplaints, have expected a like effet from\\u00b0hePe&#x27;\\nthem in the true catarrh, and have beennianotha\\nmuch surprised to find, that, by a single\\nblister unseasonably applied, which they\\nthought at least an innocent remedy, they\\nhad exasperated both the inflamnmation and\\nacrimony, to such a degree, as to render\\nthe catarrh almost incurable. But if these\\n\\nD 4 difcafe\\n\\ndiseases are-compared, they oon appear to\\nhave opposite causes.\\n\\nThe peripneumonia notha is the disease of\\ngross and bloated habits, after forty years\\nof- age, succeeds the bilious conflitution,\\nis complicated with the humor atrabila-\\nrius, and the lungs are loaded with a\\ntough, viscid, cold phlegm, without much\\ninflammation; whereas the catarrh is the\\ndisease of young, plethoric habits, under\\nthirty years of age, succeeding the inflam-\\nmatory conffitution, and complicated with\\nit, the membrana Sneideri being inflamed\\nas with an erysipelas, and discharging a\\nthin, acrid lymph; so that every incisive\\nmedicine, which does good in the one,\\nmuff do mischief in the other.\\nCatarrhous After many days, a digestion is perform-\\np&#x27;rang ed in the vessels, as appears by the change\\nflace- in the urine; and the pus thus formed, is\\n\\ndischarged by the common emundories,\\nand the expectoration of concocted matter;\\nbut if, inflead of this, a large impofihume\\nis formed on the lungs, and the pus is\\nthere deposited; or, if many small phleg-\\nmons, called tubercles, are formed on\\ntheir internal surface, then the complaint\\nchang&#x27;es its appearance, and an hectic fe-\\nver is the consequence, which is attended\\nwith peculiar symptoms: first, Of the\\nvomica tesa, well known and described by\\nauthors: And, secondly, Of a real open\\n\\nulcer,\\n\\nulcer, discharging pus, and difficult to be\\nhealed; owing partly to the firudure of\\nthe lungs, partly to the perpetual motion,\\nand continual contact with the open air,\\nto which that part is necessarily exposed:\\nhence arises the great difficulty, and almost\\nimpossibility of curing this disease in that\\nstage.\\n\\nBut in most cafes, when things are pro-catarrhous\\nperly condudced, cofion. and crisis gradu-natio f\\nally come on, and the whole disease is&#x27;\\ntotally conquered by the month of July,\\nleaving only a weakness and relaxation of\\nthe compages of the lungs: this confe-\\nquence of the disease is curable only by the\\nfame air, exercise, diet, and medicines,\\nwhich are found to be most effetual in the\\nfibris debilis et. laxa, viz. a dry, light\\nair, riding on horseback, dry nourishing\\ndiet of the antiseptic kind; chalybeate\\nwaters, bark, and cold bathing: all which\\nought to be persisted in during the months\\nof August, September, Oober, Novem-\\nber, and December, and so on to the end\\nof the catarrhous constitution; it being\\nnecessary to use all possible means to harden\\nthe constitution, without producing a ple-\\nthora; for without these precautions, re-\\nlapses are, for the most part, certain in\\nyoung people, and in our climate, as soon\\nas the catarrhous constitution returns. But\\nthough strengthening remedies become ne-\\n\\nceffary\\n\\nprevent relapses, it must ever be remernm\\nbered, that during the fever, they are per-\\nnicious, and that the air of Holland will\\nthen be more salutary than the air of Mont-\\npelier; but the most certain method I have\\nyet been able to discover for preventing a\\nrelapse in this dangerous disease, is a refi-\\ndence in the Weft-India illands till the\\npatient passes the age of twenty-five years,\\nfitut con 4. These three conflitutions, the inflam-\\ncau ofit. matory, humoral, and catarrhous, and\\n\\nthe complications of them, include all the\\ncommon distempers of the spring season:\\nbut after the summer is so far advanced as\\nto have its full effet on the body; the\\nsolids are relaxed, the salts and oils are ex-\\nalted, some of the more fluid parts of the\\nblood are exhaled, and the remainder be-\\ncomes more liable to that state, which, the\\nancients called putrid; the serum of the\\nblood becomes more yellow, the urine\\nmore loaded, the mouth more foul, and\\nthe pulse smaller: the secretion by the skin\\nis more copious, the body is more costive,\\nthe desire of drink increases, and the appe-\\ntite for solid food diminishes; people be-\\ncome more languid and indolent, and are\\napt to loiter in bed in the morning.\\n\\nHence arises a train of diseases, wholly\\ndifferent from the formcr; they are of a\\nmore putrid kind, not at all inflamma-\\n\\n7 &#x27; tory\\n\\ntory in their own nature; and are preceded\\nby the following symptoms: A propenfityPuttid fever\\nto sweat upon the least motion, rank breath it.a\\nbefore eating, a foul mouth in the morn-\\ning, a discharge of yellowish loaded urine,\\nflight flying pains, and wind in the bowels,\\nfollowed by little, fcetid, acrid stools.\\n\\nThese are the harbingers of that fever\\nwhich the ancients called fynochus putris,\\nor typhus, the Tutoi ?r vupE7o; of Hippo-\\ncrates, which Sydenham calls the variolous\\nfever; because he observed, that the con-\\nftitution which produced it, promoted and\\nexasperated the small-pox.\\n\\nThis is the only fever which we oughtPutrid ser\\nto difiinguifh by the name of putrid; thetaken.\\nwords putridfever, of late years, have had\\nno definite idea affixed to them; but are\\nused to express every ill-conditioned fever,\\nof what species soever it may be. If a\\nfirong, healthy, plethoric young person is\\ninfected with an ang ina maligna in the month\\nof February, he is said to have the putrid\\nfore throat, though the angina maligna in\\nsuch a person, and at such a season, is ra-\\nther inflammatory than putrid: this mif-\\ntake of terms must, of necessity, produce\\nfatal errors in practice.\\n\\nIt is indeed true, that the plague, the\\nfmiall-pox, and the malignant angina, are\\ngreatly promoted and exasperated by the\\nputrid confitution; and that each of them\\n\\nis\\n\\nis more contagious, and more malignant, at\\nthe season of the year when it prevails,\\nthan at any other; consequently, they\\nseem to partake of the nature of this con-\\nftitution: but it is also true, that each of\\nthese diseases is frequently met with during\\nthe inflammatory constitution, and that\\ntheymuff not then be considered wholly as\\nputrid diseases, but treated in a manner\\nfbmewhat different from that which would\\nbe proper in the dog-days, and under the\\ninfluence of the constitution which pro-\\nduces the fyntchus putris, or true putrid\\nfever. The measles and hooping-cough\\nare inflammatory diseases, and exasperated\\nby the inflammatory constitution; yet I\\nhave heard them called putrid.\\nPutrid fever, When these terrentia have continued for\\nit&#x27;s fymp-\\n,m. some days, Nature frequently relieves her-\\n\\nself by a spontaneous discharge of the mor-\\nbid colluvies, upwards and downwards;\\nbut more frequently it is found necessary\\nto&#x27; procure, or at least promote these evacu-\\nations: for the solids being relaxed, and\\nthe nerves sluggish, they are often defi-\\ncient for the purpose, and sometimes wholly\\nwanting. If no spontaneous discharge\\ntakes place, and these complaints are ne-\\ngleCed, a fixed pain and species of cramp\\nin the pit of the flomach comes on, with\\na very considerable dejeaion of Apirits,\\npain in the head and loins, ome degree\\n\\nof\\n\\nof horror, a quick depressed pulse; clammy,\\nprofuse, colliquative, symptomatic sweats,\\nwhich give no relief; and a discharge of\\nturbid water, equally symptomatic and in-\\neffedual. This is the true fynochus putris,\\nwhich is more or less dangerous, according\\nto the manner of treating it.\\n\\nUpon a comparison of this disease with Putridfevr,\\nthe fJnochus non putrrs, the rife, progrefs,wh p hesy.\\nsymptoms, and method of cure, will ap- usn\\npear to be greatly different. The dejeaion\\nof spirits in the Jynochus non putris is not\\nso great, the cramp and pain in the pit of\\nthe stomach are not so common, the&#x27; pulse\\nis not so languid, the remiflions are more\\nperceptible, the urine is not so yellow, the\\ntongue is not so foul and loaded, and the\\nsweats in the beginning are neither so pro-\\nfuse nor fcetid. After the first evacuations,\\nthe remissions are considerable; and when\\nthe proper treatment has been perfifled in\\nfor the necessary time, the disease comes to\\ncodion and crisis by the kin all at once; or\\nby repeated, regular fits, commonly at the\\nend of nine, eleven, or fourteen days; but\\nthe Jynochus putris does not remit so much,\\nand scarcely ever intermits at all; it does\\nnot require large and frequent bleedings,\\neven if the blood hbuld have a buffy ap-\\npearance; because the disposition to inflam-\\nmation is now nearly conquered, in the\\nseason which produces this fever; the serum\\n\\nof\\n\\nof the blood is more yellow than common,\\nand the bottom of the craffamentum is ge-\\nnerally of a loose texture, even when there\\nis a buff on the top.\\n\\nPlethoric people require bleeding in the\\nbeginning of all fevers, to prepare the\\nway for vomits and purges; but, cteris\\nparibus, they require less bleeding in this\\nfever than most others: the heat of a\\nfever expands the blood, particularly in\\nfull plethoric habits, and they bear the\\nhock of vomits and purges better, after\\nlosing a quantity of blood sufficient to take\\noff the tension of the vessels.\\n\\nThe Jynochlus non putris sets in like an\\ninflammatory fever, and the signs of turgid\\nmatter in the flomach or bowels do not\\nusually appear at the very beginning; but\\nin the fynochus putris, the signs of turgid\\nmatter appear early.\\n\\nDuring the first days of the fynochus non\\nputris, the patient is generally costive, and\\nbrisk emetics and cathartics are required to\\nmove the phlegm, and the second vomit\\ngenerally brings up more of it than the\\nfirst: but in thefynochus putris, the matter\\nis more easily moved; and it is not uncom-\\nmon for a purging, or species of dyfen-\\ntery, to accompany the fever throughout;\\nfor which reason, Sydenham feeins to have\\nCalled it also a dysenteric fcvcr; but it still\\n\\nrequired\\n\\nrequired no other treatment, with this\\npurging, than without.\\n\\nThere is a imilar difference between the Spring col\\nspring colic, and that which Sydenham calls cowitpae\\nthe bilious colic of the month of July andbilious.\\nthe dog-days; the spring colic, partaking\\nof the nature of the fynochus non putris,\\nis partly inflammatory, and consequently\\nrequires bleeding to a certain degree; and\\nafter ftuping, bathing, and relaxing, brisk\\npurges are necessary to evacuate the viscous\\nphlegm, and to remove the obfiruaion;\\nwhereas in the bilious colic, bleeding is\\nnot always necessary; and after proper\\nftuping and bathing, soft purges are found\\nsufficient to carry off the putrid colluvies.\\n\\nA spring fever towards the conclusion, t;ar f,\\nmay require opiates and blisters; when tmination\\nwell-treated from the beginning, it fre-\\nquently lasts from nine to fourteen or\\ntwenty-one days: a spring fever ill-treated\\nis always tedious, and may answer the de-\\nscription that hath been given of miliary\\nfevers, flow fevers, nervous fevers, febri-\\ncula, &amp;c.; but a summer fever, well-treated\\nfrom the beginning, never requires opi-\\nates or blisters; is frequently carried off\\nin four days, and seldom exceeds nine: if\\nill-treated from the beginning, it easily be-\\ncomes petechial, malignant, and often fatal\\nin a few days; at other times very anoma-\\nlous, aphthous, and tedious.\\n\\n. The\\n\\nBilious e- 5. The month of August changes the\\ndroathre p utrid conflitution into the bilious, which\\nfyuo.h us is introduced by the cholera morbus: the\\nputris and\\n\\n, putris. fever attending this constitution, commonly\\n\\ncalled the, bilious fever, is the fame with\\nthe new fever of Sydenham, and the Lu.\\nfanne fever of Tiffot. This fever resembles\\nthe fynochus putris, inasmuch as it seems\\nto arise from an acrid, yellow, morbid\\nmatter in the blood, which cannot easily\\nbe carried off but by the bowels. There are,\\nhowever, many particulars in which they\\ndiffer, and in which the bilious fever re-\\nfembles thefynochus non putris; the remif-\\nsions in the bilious fever are perceptible\\nfrom the beginning; when properly treat-\\ned, these remissions become longer and\\nlonger, and sometimes terminate in a true\\nintermittent. After eleven or fourteen\\ndays, the bilious part of the disease being\\nevacuated by vomiting and repeated purg-\\ning, or corrected by proper regimen, a kind\\nof codtion and criiis come on by fpontane-\\nous perspiration during the night, in those\\nhours in which the patient was accustomed\\nto sleep when in health; and they are al-\\nways known by the relief they give the\\nsucceeding day; insomuch that although\\nsweating in the first days of the fever did\\nnot give relief, and therefore was rather to\\nbe checked than promoted, yet after eleven\\nor fourteen days, pro re nata, of vomiting,\\n\\n^~8~~~ purging\\n\\npurging, and acids, it ought not to be\\nchecked; nay the diet may be made more\\nreflorative, and mineral acids and wine\\nadded to it, which could not be granted\\ntill the grower parts of the morbid lentor\\nhad been corrected, and evacuated by\\nthe bowels.

The bilious epidemic conltitution then\\ninut,.ioh consists of the cholera morbus, the bilious\\ncontains the\\ncholera, Ac. dysentery, the bilious fever, and the bili-\\n\\nous erysipelas: there diseases are contempo-\\n\\nrary,\\n\\nrary, or nearly so; and therefore may be\\nsaid to compose the harvest constitution,\\nespecially if the ague is taken into the ac-\\ncount: but in looking over my journals,\\nobserve, that the erysipelas was most fre- Eryfipeas,\\nquent about the very beginning of the spring\\nconltitution, i. e. during the catarrhous\\ndisposition; whereas, in harvest, the ery-\\nfipelas was most frequent towards the\\nclose of the bilious constitution, when the\\nhumor atrdtilarius began to shew itself; so\\nthat I am at a loss whether to call the har-\\nvest erysipelas a bilious, or atrabilious\\ndisease.\\n\\nSydenham compared the erysipelas to\\nthe pestilential fever; firif, Because it is\\nsometimes very rife: secondly, The nerves\\nare firangely affected before the eruption:\\nthirdly, After bleeding, pro re nata, it\\nagrees with diaphoretic treatment for forty-\\neight hours: fourthly, After which it\\nyields to purging and an antiseptic regi-\\n*men.

These diseases are frequently without\\n\\nany regular fever, and in that cafe, the\\npulse is rather more flow than in health,\\nand below the natural standard; the spirits\\nare dejeded, the sleep disturbed, the belly\\nflatulent and obflruded, the tongue foul\\nin the morning, but without any preter-\\nnatural heat or thirst. The constitution\\ncalled atrabilious is the true cause of the\\nmorbus hypochondriacus cum materia, and\\nthe meJtitia Jine cauJf in men, and of on\\nspecies of the morbus hyJiericus in women:\\nto dilute and evacuate the morbid matter of\\nthis constitution, is always a difficult and\\ntedious work, when neither cough, nor fe-\\nver, nor piles, nor gout, nor eruption, attend\\nit; and it is easily exasperated by bad\\ntreatment, and improper regimen. It fre-\\nquently produces various eruptions on the\\nIkin; such as gutte rofacee, inzetigo, herpes,\\nlichen, and the like; which, if they come\\nout plentifully, give some relief, but do\\nnot effeet a radical cure of the disease: nor\\ncan they be properly cured themselves, till\\nthe humor atrabilarius is attenuated, dilut-\\ned, and evacuated. When this conftitu-\\ntion is accompanied with a fever, this fever\\n\\nis,\\n\\nis, for the most part, lingering and tedious,\\neven if properly and patiently conduted;\\nbut may prove mortal, if an attempt is\\nmade to remove the spasmodic complaints\\nby those medicines which re called hyfte-\\nric and antispasmodic: sometimes it occa-\\nsions a colic not unlike the cholera morbus,\\nor rather the bilious colic, which, because\\nof the frequency of its returns, is often\\nimputed to spasm, gall-stones, and the like.\\nThis;colic is not difficult to remove, but\\ncannot be radically cured, so as not to re-\\nturn, without a long course of deobftruent\\ndiet and medicine.\\n\\nThe coughs of the beginning of winterpcrpneu.\\nare frequently complicated with this epi- imo\\ndemic constitution, and together produce\\nthe pe &#x27;pneumo ia notha of Sydenham: this\\npetripnenmoni a is more immediately danger-\\nous than the other atrabilious diseases, but\\nof shorter duration than many of them ;\\nfor the exercise of coughing, and the dif-\\ncharge of phlegm by expectoration, faci-\\nlitate the expulsion of the humtor atrabi-\\nlaritus, which entangled the blood and\\nobftruced the bowels. The peripneuwonia\\nnotha properly treated from the beginning,\\nfdldoin exceeds forty days; whereas some\\nof the other atrabifious diseases are very\\ntedious. I have known two years spent\\nupon some of them before the cure has\\nbeen complete, although the patients kept\\n\\n3 tco\\n\\nto a regular course of deobftruent diet and\\nmedicine and some of them paTed fix\\nweeks, in the summer months, drinking\\nthe waters at Cheltenham, and fix weeks\\nmore drinking and bathing in the sea-\\nwater: at last, however, they all reco-\\nvered.\\n\\nI have seen an ague in some, and an\\neruption of a species of herpes in others,\\nforward the operation of the deobftruent\\nmedicines. To these diseases little attention\\nwas paid; the. fame .diet and deobftruents\\nwhich preceded them were continued, e-\\ncept that for the herpes, Huxham&#x27;s essence\\nof antimony was added, with drinking\\nand bathing in the sea-water; and for the\\nague, change of air and exercise were re,\\ncommended.\\nAtrabilis The atrabilious constitution continues\\nwith a fe-\\nvae all the months of November, December,\\n\\nand January, in very open winters, (as was\\nthe cafe in 1769,) and being complicated\\nwith the inflammatory diseases of that fear\\nson, it renders the cure of them much\\nmore difficult and tedious than they com-\\nmonly are when the weather is frosty and\\ndry: hence Sydenham observes, that in\\nopen winters, the genuine inflammations\\nwere not frequent before the month of\\n,Ylarch. The species of fever which is\\nproduced by the influence of the atrabili-\\nous constitution, on diseases of the inflam-\\n\\nmatory\\n\\nmatory kind, Sydenham has hinted at\\nunder the name of winterfever; it de-\\nserves great attention, because the manner\\nof treating it differs from that which is\\nproper in a genuine inflammation. The\\ndistinguishing symptoms are as follow:\\nin the genuine inflammations, he tongue\\nis white; the urine of a flame colour, and\\ndoes not become muddy when cold, before\\ncotion begins; after the first rigor is\\nover, the eyes sparkle: the face is flushed,\\nand most commonly the {kin also; but when\\nan atrabilious diathesis is superadded, the\\ntongue is yellowish and loaded; the water\\nis muddy and jumentofa in the very begin-\\nning; the countenance is embarrassed; the\\nspirits dejected; and for the most part, there\\nis a cough and wheezing.\\n\\nWhen the inflammation is ingle, the Atrabious\\n\\n&#x27;T ~~~~~~~~~\\ns i~ 11\\nr * /* fever diftin-\\nrelief from bleeding is sudden and perma- ginedfrom\\nnent: vomits are not required, and indeed afig,,in.\\nought not to be administered; nor any\\nother purges than such as are soft, and do\\nnot irritate to a considerable degree; but\\nwhen the inflammation is complicated with\\nthe humor atrabilarius, the bleeding gives\\npresent relief, but the symptoms of reple-.\\ntion in the head, or turgid matter in the\\nbowels, soon appear, and require purges, or\\nperhaps vomits, before they can be removed.\\nThe great repletion and pain of the head,\\nand some degree of cough, or difficulty of\\n\\nE 4 breath&quot;\\n\\nbreathing, indicate something more than\\ninflammation, if they are not greatly re-\\nlieved by bleeding only.\\n\\nAn atrabilious inflammatory fever of\\nthe flight kind, after proper bleeding,\\npurging and vomiting, will frequently\\ngive way in a few days, if these evacua-\\ntions have been instituted early; but, gene-\\nrally speaking, it lasts twenty-one days, if\\nthe degree of pulse and heat has been con-\\ntinued long enough to breed a considerable\\nquantity of phlogistic lentor; o that very\\nfizy blood, of the colour of foul tallow,\\nportends a tedious fever. However, if the\\nsymptoms are not violent, it is better to\\nwait patiently, than endeavour suddenly to\\nflop its natural progress by any drug. I\\nhave frequently seen the attempt made,\\nand the fever has always become ill-condi-\\ntioned, without being hortened; whereas,\\nwhen the pressing symptoms were well\\nattended to, and nothing violent has been\\nattempted, the fever indeed has frequently\\nbeen tedious, but the patient&#x27;s recovery has\\nat last been perfet; for, on or before the\\ntwenty-firft day, the fever subsided, and\\nnothing remained but a cough, and critical\\nsalutary cxpectoration of thick digested\\nmatter. This fever also. remits soon after\\nthe first evacuations, and sometimes termi-\\nhates in an ague, which rarely happens in\\ngenuine inflammations; there always pro-\\n\\nceed\\n\\nceed to perfect cotion, and come to ome\\ncrisis in a hort time, without any confi-\\nderable, regular, lasting remission, except\\nwhat may have arisen from evacuations\\nduring the crude slate; but the mixed\\nfevers remit sensibly and early.\\n\\n7. The last of the common fevers is the\\nague, which seems to have its feat in the\\nlarge bowels; we seldom meet with agues\\nduring the height of either the inflamma-\\ntory, or the putrid constitutions; but they\\nare very frequent in spring, during the\\nphlegmatic constitution, and during the\\nbilious and atrabilious couftitutions of the\\nlatter season; when the colluvies collected\\nin the stomach and intestines obftruds the\\nexcretions of the vicera of the abdomen.\\nThe agues of the spring almost always\\ngive way to the month of July; perhaps,\\nbecause the phlegm being attenuated, does\\nnot at that season so much obftrud those\\nexcretions.\\n\\nThe agues of the bilious constitution, if\\nthey are flopped before the bilious morbid\\nlentor is evacuated, bring on a continual\\nfever, in the ame manner as the spring\\nagues, when they are stopped before the\\nphlegm or pituite is removed. but after the\\nphlegm is evacuated in spring, or the bili-\\nous matter in harvest, the ague will com-\\nmonly yield to the bark, given in a proper\\nclualltity between the fits.\\n\\nThe\\n\\nThe ague complicated with the humor\\natrabitar&#x27;iu; that is, with a morbid lentor\\nof a more viscid nature than bile; more\\nremote, and more out of the reach of eva-\\ncuating medicines, requires more patience,\\nand is, for that reason, more difficult to\\nmanage; for while the viscera are thus ob-\\nftruded, the bark and tonic medicines will\\nseldom cure the ague; they may indeed\\nIbmetimes fop it and confirm the obftruc-\\ntion, or rive the humor atrabilarius all\\nover the body, so as to breed various chro-\\nnic distempers, or give that wax-like colour\\n(so well known) to the skin: but if these\\nmedicines flop the ague under such cir-\\ncumftances, it is generally but for a few\\ndays; after which, it often returns with\\ndouble violence. In this cafe, it hould\\nalways be remembered, that the original\\ncause of such an ague, is the humor atra-\\nbilarzus, which always occasions a tedious\\ndisease, hardly ever lating less than forty\\ndays, and frequently many months. That\\nwith refped to the ague, nothing more\\nihould be done than to moderate the vio-\\nlence of the fits, and to support the patient\\nproperly on the days of interval, and that\\nthe diet, cxercife, and remedies should be\\ndireaed wholly to attenuate, dilute, and\\nevacuate the atrabilious lentor, as if the\\nague were out of the qucflion.\\n\\nFrom\\n\\nFrom this practice two advantages will\\nrife; firirf The life of the patient will\\nnot be endangered, in most cafes, even if\\nthe ague hould go on to the month of July\\nfollowing: secondly, When the atrabilious\\nlentor has been correEted or evacuated,\\nwhich the repeated fits of the ague will\\nfacilitate, the ague will probably stop of\\nitself radically, and without any danger of\\na relapse, or easily give way to the specific\\nin a hort time, and with propriety.\\n\\nA true ague is to be diftinguiihed from\\nevery other fever by two symptoms ; first,\\nThe frigus, rigor, and horror febrilis, at\\nthe beginning of every fit: and, secondly,\\nAn absolute apyrexia between the fits,\\nwhich do not happen either in the heica\\npurulenta, nor in the disease which Boer-\\nhaave used to call the heSica Anglicana.\\n\\nThere is indeed one species of intermit-\\ntent which greatly resembles an ague, viz.\\nthe hemicrania, or megrim, commonly\\ncalled an ague in the head, or rather in the\\nface; a disease, which, though most fre-\\nquent in spring, appears at different sea-\\nions; and consequently, in some degree,\\nrequires a different method of cure. This,\\nperhaps, is one reason why what has fuc-\\nceeded in one cafe, has often been found\\nto fail in others. A true hemicrania is\\nregularly periodical, and attended by no\\n\\u00f3ther fever than that which aifcs fiom\\n\\nthe\\n\\nthe violence of the pain; so that it is easily\\ndiftinguifled from other chronic, nervous,\\nand hysteric headachs, which are less regu-\\nlar; and from such pains as arise from an\\nincongruity of the solid parts, and from\\nsuch as accompany continual remitting or\\nintermitting fevers.\\n\\nThese things being well explained, it will\\nbe more easy to understand the history of\\nthe true, malignant, and contagious fevers,\\nto account for the variety of symptoms\\nobservable in them, and to ascertain the\\nbest manner of treating them.\\n\\nTHE\\n. .. .~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nOBSERVATIONS\\n\\nON THE\\nNATURE AND CURE\\n\\nor\\nF E V E R S,\\n\\nPART II,\\n\\nOF\\nMALIGNANT FEVERS IN GENERAL,\\n\\nAND OF\\nTHE ANGINA MALIGNA IN PARTICULAR,\\n\\n[ 61 3\\nTHE\\nMALIGNANT FEVERS.\\nHITHERTO I have confidered only\\n\\nthe simple fevers, which arise, as one\\nmay fay, from sensible causes, and are by\\nfar the mos frequent; nor have they any\\nreal malignity naturally belonging to them;\\nbut are as uniform and regular in their\\ngrowth and procedure as most other natu-\\nral productions, so long as they are treated\\nproperly .\\n\\nTrue\\n* It would seem, that every body naturally collects Fever, its\\ncertain humours, which, if suffered to remain long, natural\\nmight accumulate, or corrupt, so as to destroy theeffeand\\nfunctions of the organs: to prevent which Nature pro-\\nduces a fever, by which there morbid humours are\\ncorreaed, or expelled, and perse&amp; health restored.\\nAnd indeed we find, that when the fever has been\\nproperly conducted, the health is mended by it: but\\nif the fever has been ill-treated, although the party\\nmay escape with their life, yet there remains, for the\\nmolt part, a bad tfate of health, and a chronic diftem-\\nper: and this is one cause of the great encreafe of\\nsudden deaths and chronic diseases in this city for fe-\\n\\nveral\\n\\n.&#x27;evers ma- True malignant fevers are not common,\\n\\nnt do and consequently some people of small ex-\\n\\nperience and lender capacities have ima-\\ngined, that there is no other malignity in\\nfevers, than what arises from bad practice;\\nso that their whole procedure in all fevers,\\nand in all stages of fevers, is a routine of\\nbleeding, vomiting, purging, whey, vege-\\ntable diet, and neutral salts: this indeed is\\nthe lesser evil, because they will frequently\\nbe right, and it is a pracice that fits the\\nlevel of their sagacity. But every man of\\nextensive practice, endued with knowlege\\nand penetration, will oon discover fymp-\\ntoms not natural to the common fevers;\\nbut arising from a certain malignity in\\nsome fevers, happening at certain seasons,\\nin those parts even of this city, where the\\npeople are much crouded together, and\\nbreath the perfpirable matter of each other;\\nparticularly where cleanliness is negleted,\\nand the apartments not properly ventilated\\nveral years pall. This hews the neccfity of attend-\\ning carefully to the convalescent ttate of fevers.\\n\\nThe circulation of our blood also fabricates a species\\nof volatile salt, which becomes very acrid, if suffered\\nto accumulate and remain too long in the body;\\nwhich is still much encrcafed by the violent heat and\\nmotion of a fever. This proves the propriety of dila-\\ntion in all fevers, according to the violence and nature\\nof them; and the necessity of soft and antiacrid regi-\\n\\nen after the fever is lubdued.\\n\\n4 If\\n\\nIf any man will carefully read Roupe on\\nthe febris critica, he will find the febris\\nhumoralis, complicated with a hip malig-\\nnity, of a contagious nature: Hafennorle\\ndescribes the catarrhous fever complicated\\nwith a camp or hospital malignity: Hux-\\nham has seen the fame at Plymouth, both\\nin the ships and gaols; and all our army\\nphysicians are well acquainted with it.\\n\\nWe had a remarkable instance here of a Gaol fever,\\ngaol fever, communicate to several people ctching&#x27;\\nat the fame instant in the Old Bailey, most\\nof whom died in a few days: the servants\\nand attendants upon them were afterwards\\ninfected; but the fever was not quite so\\ndeadly as the first; and thus it diminished\\ngradually, (as I was informed by a gentle-\\nman at that time in full practice) till it\\nquite disappeared; so that such as caught\\nit at the third hand were hardly in any\\ndanger from it.\\n\\nThis however serves to prove, that the\\npeople who attend in these prisons, hips,\\nhospitals, and the like, do frequently carry\\nin their clothes a degree of poison, which\\nalthough it does not affeta them.who are\\naccuflomed to it, yet is very deadly to\\nstrangers and others, who are not daily ex-\\nposed to it ~. A good deal of such miaf;\\n\\n* All poisons are known to at ]ess and less from\\nbeing frequently used; so that the conltitution seems\\nto become habituated to them;\\n\\nmata\\n\\nmata adhering to the clothes of such people,\\nmay be scattered about in different parts of\\nthis city; and the very fame symptoms\\nwhich accompanied this Newgate. fever,\\nhave been seen frequently in fevers at dif-\\nferent times by some experienced prati-\\ntioners. Which has obliged them to the\\nuse of alexipharmics, in some such cafes,\\nwith good success; and is perhaps the rea-\\nson why less discreet practitioners have\\nfallen into the fatal miflake of giving such\\nquantities of heating remedies in all the\\ncommon fevers; to the destruction of num-\\nbers of worthy people.\\n\\nIt becomes, therefore, the business of\\nevery physician to make himself so much\\nmaster of fevers, as to distinguish when a\\ncommon fever is simple, and when it is\\ncomplicated with a malignant contagion.;\\nand then, when a malignant fever is simple,\\nor complicated with a common fever or\\nFever ma. any other contagion.

(vide\\nSwan&#x27;s traiJation): gives his idea of malig-\\nnant fevers arising from contagion.\\n\\n&quot; I conceive then, that malignity in Contagion\\n&quot;epidemics, whatever its specific nature,,hat.\\n&quot;may be, consists and centers in very hot\\n\\nand spiritous particles, that are more or\\n&quot; less opposite to the nature of the circu-\\n\\nlating fluids; because such particles only\\n&quot;are capable of producing so sudden an\\n&quot;alteration of them, as is frequently ob-\\n&quot;served in malignant diseases. And &#x27;I\\n&quot;judge that those hot and spiritous par-\\n&quot;tides a chiefly by way of assimilation;\\n&quot; because by the law of nature every adive\\n&quot;principle endeavours to produce its like,\\n&quot; and to reduce and mould whatever op-\\n&quot; poses it to its own nature: thus fire ge-\\n&#x27; nerates fire, and a person seized with a\\n&quot;malignant disease affeds another by an\\n&#x27; emission of spirits, which soon aflimi-\\n&quot; late the juices to themselves, and change\\n&quot; them into their own nature.&quot;\\n\\nArt. 4. 1. c. &quot; From these confidera-\\n&quot;tions it follows, that it is best to expel\\n&quot; them by sweat, since by this means the\\n&quot; disease would be immediately eradicated.\\n&quot; In the plague (the most subtile and ma-\\n&quot; lignant of all fevers) the pefitential par-\\n\\nF 4 tides\\n\\n4, tides are diffipable (in the beginning)\\n&lt;&quot; and may be expelled by a continual\\n&quot; sweat. But in fevers where the affmi.\\n4&#x27; lating particles are less subtile, and mixed\\n&quot; with grosser humors, such as purple\\n&quot; spots in fevers, and black eruptions in\\n&quot; the fmnall.pox, the malignant humor\\n&quot; cannot be expelled by sweat, and is fre-\\n&quot; quently increased by the diaphoretics\\n&quot; given to promote it: on the contrary,\\n&#x27; according to the coolness of the regimen\\n&quot;&#x27; employed, which is very suitable to them,\\n&quot; they are used to decrease and diminish,\\ne as daily experience shews *.&quot;\\n\\nArt.\\n* I would explain this observation thus. When\\nthe contagion has fubfifled in an inflammatory habit,\\nlong enough and in that degree as to breed much\\nfizy lentor, (i. e. mixed with grofler humors) then the\\nsudorific method will not succeed ; but an antiphlo-\\ngiflic method is required till the inflammation is sub-\\ndued. But if the fame conagion seizes a person,\\nwhose tender blood is dissolved by it (as in the cafe of\\npurples, &amp;c.) then the sudorifics will again do mif-\\nchief; because an antiseptic method becomes necef-\\nfary.\\n\\nSo that, notwithftandling the contagion, the anti-\\nphlogistic method, to a certain degree, in the inflam-\\nmatory state, and the antiseptic, in the dissolved, or\\nputrid fate of the blood, will agree with the whole\\nfever, whatever the nature of the particular contagion\\nmnay be. And this is confirmed by Huxham, Angina\\nwaligna, p. 35.\\n\\n&quot; I will not fay but, in Come plethoric habits, ome\\n*&#x27; blood may be drawn at the beginning of this di-\\n\\n&quot;G cafe,\\n\\nArt. 17. &quot; But which way soever it be,\\ni&#x27; I cannot even so much as conjecure\\n&quot; what other method of cure ought to be\\n&#x27; used to conquer the malignity, besides\\n&#x27; that which is suitable to the epidemic,\\n,&#x27; wherewith it is joined. So that whether\\n&quot; the epidemic be of the number of those\\n&quot; wherein the febrile matter must first be\\n&quot;( concoced, and soon after properly ex-\\n&quot; pelled by sweat; or of those that are ter-\\n&#x27; minated by ome eruption; or of those\\n&quot; that require the assistance of art to make\\n\\nway for them: in all those kinds, the\\n( malignity, which is the concomitant of\\n&quot;the disease, will rife and fink, continue\\n&quot; and go off with the original disease; and\\n&quot;consequently whatever evacuation agrees\\n&quot;in general with the epidemic fever,\\n&quot;agrees likewise with the malignity, how\\n\\nmuch soever these evacuations may be of\\n&quot;a contrary nature to each other. Hence\\n&quot; when the harvest intermittents are epi-\\n&quot; cafe, and I have in some few ordered it with ad-\\n&quot; vantage, particularly as to the anginose symptoms,\\n&quot; and where the difficulty of breathing also was con-\\n&quot; fiderable ;&quot; and again 1. c. p 52. &quot; There were\\n&quot;certainly ome of those ulcerous fore throats, with\\n&quot;a pretty smart fever, that bore bleeding in the be-\\n&quot;ginning with advantage, and a much cooler regi-\\nmen was neceflary in ome than in others; nay I\\n&quot;was obliged in several cafes to give nitre with the\\n&quot; diaphoretics.&quot;\\n\\n&quot; demic,\\n\\n&quot; &#x27;demic, any malignity which accompanies\\n&quot; the fevers of autumn, (although for corn.\\n\\nmon they do not agree with sweating)\\n&quot; will yield to the sweat of a. fit of the\\n&quot;ague, which follows coaion as its es.\\nC fed.&quot;\\nMia;gnity Sydenham, that great obferver.of Nature,\\ndivided into, *\\neal and ar- &#x27;has in.another place divided malignity into\\n\\nfii two different kinds: the first is, or may be\\n\\ncalled artificial, arising from neglect, or\\nmore frequently from bad practice, in the\\ncommon fevers; and consequently to be\\nmet with every day: the other is not so\\ncommon, because it arises from uncommon\\ncauses, viz. from a particular contagionfuii\\ngeneri s; is communicated by infection only,\\nand gradually diminishes till at length it\\nwears out: these may be called the peti-\\nLft offpeli. lential fevers, e. g.

The\\nplague; angina maligna; gaol, hospital,\\ncamp, and hip fevers; and the fevers\\narising from the tfench, or eating putrid\\nsubstances, spoiled grain, and the like; to\\nwhich some dyfenteries, perhaps the eryfi.\\npelas, and one species of miliary fever, may\\nbhe added.\\n\\nSydenhami\\n\\nSydenham, c. 2. fe&amp;. . art. I. &quot; I have\\n,&#x27; already cursorily observed, that some fe-\\n( vers are ufuatly ranked amongst those of\\n\\nthe malignant kind; whereas the vio-\\n&quot; lence of their symptoms, which seems to\\n&quot; countenance this opinion, does not pro-\\n&quot; ceed from the contagious, nature of the\\n&quot; disease, but from unskilful treatment.\\n&quot;( For when we do not closely enough at-\\n&quot; tend to the solution thereof appointed by\\n&quot; Nature, but inconsiderately pirfue a dif-\\n\\nferent method, we greatly disorder the\\n&quot; animal oeconomy: whence the disease,\\n&quot; contrary to its nature, now different from\\n&quot;what it used to be, is accompanied with\\n\\nseveral irregular symptoms. But a true\\n&quot;malignant fever rarely happens, and to-\\n&quot;tally differs from other fevers that are\\n&quot; so called from the irregularity of their\\n&quot; symptoms; being indeed of the fame\\n\\ngenus with the plague, only not so vio.-\\n&quot;lent.&quot;\\n\\nTo produce any pestilential fever three Pefiletial\\nthings are required, First, E.fluvia, pefti- fever,how\\nlential matter, or feminizum (as Sydenham pro .\\ncalls it) bred in a certain spot, and conveyed\\nimmediately by an infected person; or me-\\ndiately by some substance impregnated\\ntherewith. Thus the plague is traced into\\nArabia; the finall-pox into Egypt; the an-\\ngina malignq into the Archipelago; and\\n\\nthe\\n\\nthe gaol fever into Newgate. Secondly, It\\nis required that the body should be disposed\\nto receive the infection; for some people\\ncannot be infe&amp;ed at one time, and yet are\\neasily so at another. Thirdly, There must\\nalso be a particular confRitution which pro-\\nmotes the growth of this feminium; thus\\nthe summer months, during the putrid and\\nbilious epidemic constitutions, are found to\\npropagate and exasperate the plague, angi-\\n\\naa maliga, and small-pox; whereas the\\ninflammatory conflitution flops the plague,\\nand renders the small-pox less virulent;\\nbut on the contrary it exasperates the\\nmeasles and hooping cough; which are\\nquite ftopt, or rendered very mild by the\\nmonth of July and the dog-days *.\\nChwaea..i In the beginning these fevers have fymp-\\nticefa~ig1\\n\\nife. toms common to them, and to all fevers,\\n\\n* In the frumer 1770, I aw one hundred people\\nill of the measles; ome of them had juR recovered\\nfrom the hooping cough: the meafes were very mild\\nin all of them; only one required a second bleeding:\\nall of them agreed with gentle purging, and a mild\\nantiCeptic regimen : in many of them the fever was so\\nmild, and so soon over, that it required a perse.\\nknowledge of the disease to diftinguith it from a com-\\nmon rash fever. The cough always went off soon\\nafter the fever, and did not return again. In some\\ncafes laying in bed and encouraging a weat brought\\non a dirorder in the head; which however was oon\\nremoved by proper bleeding, purging, open air, ere&amp;\\npofiure, and eating ripe fruit plentifully.\\n\\nviz.\\n\\nviz. A chilliness succeeded by heat, quick-\\nness of the pulse, sickness at the fomach,\\npain in the head and loins, retleffnefs,\\nthirst and anxiety: but they have one\\nsymptom peculiar to themselves, (all except\\nthe measles and hooping cough) viz. A de-\\nje&amp;ion of spirits, and failure of strength far\\nbeyond what might be expeaed from the\\nviolence of the other symptoms, and hort\\nduration of the fever, when not attended\\nwith malignity: and this is what gives the\\nfirfi suspicion of malignity. This symptom\\nhowever frequently arises from plethora, or\\nturgid matter in the flomach and bowels,\\neven in common fevers; these mufft there-\\nfore be examined, and removed according\\nto the rules already given for conduaing\\nthose fevers. When such evacuations give\\nrelief, we have reason to hope that there is\\nno uncommon malignity: but if on the\\ncontrary the weakness and dejecion in-\\ncrease, we have itrong reason to fufpe real\\nmalignity, and muff confider carefully what\\nspecies of peflilential fever rages at the\\ntime; for it is of great consequence to dif-\\ncover early the identical peftilcnce: thus\\nfar they resemble each other, but in a few\\ndays they betray some charateriftic fymp-\\ntom, because they go off in different ways;\\nthat is, the plague by an eruption of bu- v.,ioutr-\\n\\nminaion of\\nbocs, parotids, and carbuncles fJi generis; nai.nang\\n\\nthc fver..\\n\\n.the ifmall-pox by eruptions in the skin fit\\ngeneris; the measles and erysipelas in like\\nmanner; the hooping cough by an expec-\\ntoration of matter by convulive paroxysms;\\nthe angina maligna by sweat, and a fluxion\\nof acrid fetid matter on the glands of the\\nfauces; and all the reft chiefly by sweat,\\naccording to the observation of Sydenham,\\nContin.

I ordered him to lose some blood, be\\nshifted, and afterwards to take a vomit.\\n\\nThe following morning the pulse was good; the\\npain in the head gone; his spirits were returned, and\\nhis tongue was cleaner: but the pain in the back and\\nlimbs remained: he was immediately purged with the\\nptisan, drank plentifully of lemon beverage, and was\\nquite well the day after.\\n\\ngoes\\n\\ngoes off after a manner peculiar to itrelf;\\nand therefore requires a treatment pecu-\\nliarly adapted to itself; and that a perfect\\nknowledge of any one of them does not\\nteach the true knowledge of any other of\\nthem.

In single common fe- ow todir.\\nvers, particularly of the summer and har- tInil^g a\\nvest, he observed, that the patient was very fever from\\n\\nY a common\\napt to sweat in the very beginning, and fever in te\\nprevious to the other evacuations; but that beginnin.&quot;\\nthis sweat was symptomatic, owing to the\\nhurry of Nature, and consequently afford-\\ned no relief; it was therefore not to be\\npromoted, nor regarded, but the fever was\\nto be treated as if no such sweat had ap-\\npeared ; and every day&#x27;s experience con-\\nfirms this observation.\\n\\nG 2 But\\n\\nBut in single pestilential fevers, even of\\nthe fame seasons, a sweat always gave re,\\nlief; and sometimes carried off the whole\\nfever, when single and of a very subtile na-\\nture; and therefore was to be promoted to\\na certain degree, that is, as long as it as.\\nforded relief, and no longer. Thus e.g.\\nwhen a healthy person has been kept upon\\na proper regimen for fix weeks, and then\\ninoculated for the small-pox; after some\\ndays, certain uneasy feelings, called the ter-\\nrentia morbi, arise, and go off by a gentle\\nperspiration during the night, which does\\nno harm; but on the contrary is salutary,\\nand foretells a favourable fort, as I have\\nobserved hundreds of times: but if any one\\nhould be so rash as to endeavour to carry\\noff the whole disease by promoting that\\nsweat all the next day, and beyond a certain\\ndegree, then indeed he would bring on a\\nnew distemper, and overset the whole course\\nof Nature in conduting the small-pox.\\nDireafed I can fay from careful observation, that\\n,bSi&#x27;i0.

I ordered his body\\nto be opened by a clyster, to give him\\nplenty of peCtoral decoCtion, much acidu-\\nlated with common oxymel; every four\\nhours to take one of the following draughts,\\nand a glass of Rhenish wine between every\\ntwo draughts: in hopes of relieving the\\nbreathing, and raising the pulse, a blister\\nwas put to the back.\\n\\nR Julep. e camphor. ifs.\\n\\nSpir. minder. syr. croc. aa 3ii. m.\\nThe next day in dressing the blister, Mr.\\nLoutit, the apothecary, observed some tu-\\nmors, in number seven, of a dark brown\\ncolour, about the size of nutmegs, and the\\nbases were circumscribed by a red line like\\nthe edges of an efchar: these tumors dif-\\nsered from the common vibices or phlyc-\\ntele, and I expected to bring them to\\nfilppuration, by adding tinture of bark\\nand alexipharmics to the draught, and in-\\ncreasing the quantity of wine in the diet:\\ntlefe tumors, however, by degrees became\\n\\nG 4 more\\n\\nmore flat and broad, at last the red margin\\nbecame purple, and he died on the 7th of\\nAugust, being, as I supposed, the 8th day\\nof the fever.\\n\\nWhen I confider the manner in which this\\nfever was treated in the middle of the dog-\\ndays, I hould have expeced an eruption of\\npurples, or petechial spots; but these tu-\\nmors were different from what I had ever\\nseen before, or have since; and therefore I\\ncall them carbuncles: however, nobody\\nwas infeced, which, for ought I know,\\nmight be owing to the precautions taken\\nbefore and after his death: but I will ven-\\nture to ay, that I might have had a better\\nchance to conquer the malignityof this fever\\nby the methods already proposed in treat-\\ning the putrid fever of July, than by the\\nalexipharmics I made use of, from the per-\\nsuasion of some peftilentialfeminium, which\\nI endeavoured to carry off by the skin;\\nnor did the blister, bark, or cordials answer\\nany of the intentions for which they were\\napplied.\\nrenilcntial In confidering the contagious fevers, it is\\nlgrand. very necessary to distinguish between the\\nm&#x27;&#x27;gn. single mild pestilential, and the very malig-\\n\\nnant or compound pestilential fevers: for\\nalthough every pestilential fever has some\\ndegree of malignity in its essence, as con-\\ntaining an active principle, or power of\\n\\naflmnilating\\n\\nassimilating our juices to its own nature,\\nyet the quantity so assimilated will depend\\nupon the habit, and other circumstances of\\nthe ick: thus a grain of variolous matter\\ntaken into the blood, aflimilates a quantity\\nof our juices; but fill that- quantity will\\nbe different in different fubjets, and con-\\nfequently the whole disease more or less\\nmalignant accordingly.\\n\\nIn like manner, if the matter, which Faait;,\\ngave rife to a common fever, is long de-&quot;&#x27;i&quot;it\\ntained in the body, so as to become highly\\nacrid and active, it also becomes malignant,\\nand acquires a power of assimilating our\\njuices; after which we find it also becomes\\ncontagious, although it was not so origi-\\npally. Thus the inactive pituite which\\ngives rife to the fynochus non putris, is, by\\nmeans of a moderate fever, gradually fe-\\nparated from the blood, and prepared for\\nexpulsion; during which time the sweat,\\nand other critical discharges of the patient,\\nare by no means contagious. But if the\\nrecrementitious matter is very long de-\\ntained in the body, especially if it is exaf-\\nperated by hot and spiritous regimen, it\\nwill at length become acrid, subtile, and\\nafive; after which, if it is reabsorbed and\\nmixed with the blood, it will produce a\\nmiliary fever, which may be called malig-\\nnarlt, ad in some degree contagious; al-\\n\\nthough\\n\\nthough the original fever was no such\\nthing. Here then, by bad practice, a new\\ncontagion may be produced, and communi.\\ncated to many, as is the, cafe in hospitals\\nvery often, where the convalescents are\\nweak and consequently easily infeced *\\nDoctor Stork gives an exaa account of a\\nmiliary fever in his hospital for every\\nmonth of one whole year; which, to me,\\nis a proof of its being contagious in that\\nhospital, although in general I am entirely\\nof Du Haen&#x27;s opinion, who has most ju-\\ndicioufly accounted for the frequency of\\nmiliary fevers in words to the following\\npurpose :\\n\\nThe art of chemiJry, Jo much cultivated\\nin Germany, has mled the pratlitioners of\\nVienna into the fatal error of endeavouring\\nto cure fevers by the force of powerful\\ndrugs; in con/equence of which, I find the\\ncommon fevers frequently converted into nmi\\nliary ones; the Jick come into my hospital\\nevery day covered with tefe eruptions,\\n=which are so far from being critical, that\\nthey afford no fort of relief; they only serve\\nas Jigns of bad praftice, and ill condition of\\nthe fever: we therefore treat the fever as\\nif no such eruption had appeared, andfor\\nthe mos part Jitcceed.

Thus, by the journals\\nDo&amp;or-Chenot, we find, that in one tow\\nin Tranfilvania, out of 62 infected wit\\nthe plague, 5 died; and in the village o\\nHonigfberg, out of io infected, 9 died:\\nlike manner, all the other contagious fever\\nleft to Nature, are by far more dangeroi\\nthan the common fevers left to Nature.\\n\\nBut after the nature of the contagio\\nfever is well understood, and consequent\\ntreated properly, a great many :lives a\\nsaved by art. Thus we know, that thena\\ntural small-pox, left to Nature, defroy\\nnearly one out of eight; but by the trea\\nment of Do&amp;or Du Haen, very few di\\nout of an hundred. I know that ome pe\\npie do not believe his account of this mat\\nter; but I make no doubt of it, because\\ncan easily fee, from his other writings, tha\\nhe is more mafler of fevers in general tha\\nis commonly thought in this country.\\n\\nNo wonder then, if a new contagio\\ncoming into any country flould be ill\\n\\ntreatsc\\n\\ntreated before the nature of it can be found\\nout; but after it is once well underflood,\\nit becomes lets formidable. This was the\\ncafe with the angina maligna, or ulcerated\\nfore throat, so frequent and well known\\nhere at present: when it firit&#x27;appeared, both\\nhere and at Paris, almost every body died\\nwho took the infecion, and had the disease\\nto a considerable degree; at present, very\\nfew die of .it: not that the distemper is\\nless malignant, for, by injudicious treat-\\nment, we fee ome periih by it at this day;\\nbut the nature of it being generally under-\\nstood, viz. that the natural crisis of this\\nditemper is by an early sweat, and a fluxion\\nupon the glands of the fauces, every body\\nendeavours to promote these evacuations,\\nand consequently this fever, at least during\\nthe beginning of it, is commonly treated\\naccording to its natural genius. But till t\\nfay of this, as I do of every fever from\\ncontagion; that although the jeminium be\\ninvariably the fame, yet the disease pro.\\nduced by it will not be invariably the fame,\\nbut will undergo some alteration according\\nto the habit of the party infected, and the\\ncommon fever of the season for the time\\nbeing; and therefore may require a diffe-\\nrent treatment, in different fubjeds, and in\\ndifferent seasons, or circumflances.\\n\\nTo demonstrate this proposition, and to&#x27;Thevati\\nexplain the variety to be met vith in one met w&#x27;itli\\n\\nH 2 pefti-&quot;&#x27; cp\\n\\nlential fe pestilential disease,&#x27;. we hall&#x27; fee how thd\\nlfied n nlcerated fore throat varies. ift, When\\n.angj finagle, in an healthy clean conflittition\\n\\n2dly, Double&#x27;, &#x27;r&#x27;fuperadded to a delicate\\nhabit. 3dly, CGomrNex, or mixed with a\\nCommon fever or bad habit of&#x27;body.

And\\nthis is the riafon- why I hav&#x27;: taken pains\\nto explain the common fevers in the first\\nplace; because, till they are perfectly- un-\\nderflood, it. is impossible to come at the\\nLnowlcdge of the fevers ariting from con-\\ntaglon, super.added to them. I have made\\nchoice of the angina nmaligna, for the pur-\\npose of explaining the contagious fevers;\\nbecaufc it is very frequent here at present,\\nand has been ib for some years past; is\\ncafily distinguished from every other con-\\ntagiorn, and its natural crilis is acertained:\\nalthough there fill remain some things,\\n\\n7 regarding\\n\\nregarding the uncommon symptoms, which\\nhave not hitherto been properly explained.\\n\\nThe angina maligna, pejlential.s, or ul- ,,~iama-\\ncerated fore throat, is a real contagion fi4i&quot;a&#x27; what\\ngeneris; not the natural producion of this\\ncountry, but brought hither, by communi-\\ncation with inseted people or places, about\\nthe year I728. How long this contagion\\nmay remain in the body before it produces\\na fever, is not as yet determined; because\\nthat must vary according to the epidemic\\nconstitution, and cireumftances of the per-\\nson at the time of infeion; for the most\\npart the terrentia are felt within seven\\ndays; I have seen it much sooner.\\n\\nThe daughter of Mr. Daniel Grant of\\nJamaica was brought home from school so\\nill of this disease that he could not fwal-\\nlow: her nose was fluffed, and discharged\\na thin ichor; to clear which, the fond fa-\\nther fucked her nose with his mouth: he\\ndied two days after, and he was taken ill\\nthe fame day with the terrentia morbi,\\nwhich were at first mistaken for the grief\\noccasioned by the loss of his child; but\\nin the space of hours, the fever came on\\nin so violent a manner, with all its variety\\nof symptoms, that he barely escaped with\\nhis life: nor could we discover any other\\nperson from whom he could have taken the\\ninfection.\\n\\nH 3 A young\\n\\nA young gentleman, Master F. came\\nfrom school infeced on the I th of Aprill\\nthe fever came on the i3th; his brother fell\\nill on the iSth; his mother on the i9tht\\nbut his sifter did not fever till the I ft, al,\\nthough they were all equally exposed to\\nthe fame infetion from the boy first taken\\nill. -\\n\\nThe terrentia are not of long,continu-\\nance, seldom beyond o2 hours, after which\\nthe rigor begins; the degree of rigor\\nforetels, in a great measure, the violence\\nof the succeeding fever: if the extremities\\nare very cold, and continue so for many\\nhours; if the anxiety is great and the vor\\nmiting and purging violent, or of long du-\\nration, you may conclude that there ire\\nsome of the common fevers along with the\\ncontagious one, and therefore the whole\\nmay be tedious or dangerous: all the com-\\nmon fevers, for the most part, have a ter-\\nrentia of many days; they seem to come\\ngradually, and give some warning; but\\nwhen a contagion is added to a common\\nfever, it is like fire in tinder; all is in a\\nblaze, and the fever comes on suddenly\\nwith violence; the rigor is of long dura-\\ntion, and the anxiety very great: Malfer\\nF. had a kind of horror for 6 hours; and\\nalternate heats and colds for days, the\\nvomiting and fickncfi lafied 20 houra, he-\\n\\nfore\\n\\nfore he complained much of the heat and\\npepper (as he called it) in his throat: this\\nfever accordingly became tedious and highly\\nmalignant, as we shall fee afterwards. His\\nbrother, who was seized 2 days after him,\\nhad a very evere rigor, but of short dura-\\ntion; for an extreme burning heat came on\\nin the space of a few hours, with a violent\\npulse, inflamed eyes, and delirium. I or-\\ndered him to be blooded, after which the\\nfever formed, and went through its course\\nregularly to the 5th day; it then subsided,\\nand went off the 7th day.\\n\\nFrom many such observations, I have\\nreason to believe that the degree and dura-\\ntion of the cold and rigor, at the very be-\\nginning, indicate the good or bad condition\\nof the fever, more than the succeeding de-\\ngree of heat, and inflammatory symptoms:\\nin the fame way as we find violent, tedious\\ncold fits attend obfiinate agues; whereas\\nthe burning hot fits, with much fluffing\\nof the Ikin, is most common in spring ter-\\ntians.

But to return to Sy-\\ndenham, Art. 43.\\n\\n&quot; But to resume my subjea, I -dret the\\n&quot; sweat to be continued 24 hours, by giv-\\n( ing draughts of sage posset drink or mace\\nt ale, between times, frily cautioning\\n:&quot; againfl wiping off the sweat, and not al-\\n&quot; lowing the patients linen to be changedi\\n&quot; however moist or foul it be, for 24 hours\\n&quot;&#x27; more after the sweat is gone off (making\\ni in all 48 hours) and this I recommend\\n&quot; to be observed with particular care. For\\n&quot; if the sweat vnifhes in less time, &#x27;the\\n&#x27; symptoms immediately return with their\\n&quot; former violence, and, the health of the\\n&quot; -patient is greatly endangered; which a\\nC&quot; longer continuance of the sweat would\\n&quot; have quite secured.&quot;\\n\\nArt. 44, &quot; And in reality, I wonder\\n&quot;much at-Diemerbroeck and others, when\\n&quot; I confider upon how flight a pretext they\\n&quot; are induced to flop the sweat, namely to\\n\\npreserve the strength of the patient. For\\n&#x27;&quot; Ift, That the patient is fironger whilst\\n&quot; the sweat flows than before, must have\\n&quot; been observed by&#x27;every one that is but\\n&quot;slenderly acquainted with the treatment\\n&quot; of this disease. 2dly, I shall not scruple\\n\\n&quot; to\\n\\n&quot; to publish and defend what pratice arid\\n&quot; experience have taught me with refpet\\n&quot; to this matter:&#x27; several, who by my ad-\\n( vice were kept in a sweat for 24 hours,\\n&quot; have been so far from complaining of\\n\\ngreater weakness from thence, that they\\n&quot; have declared, that in the fame propor-\\n&quot; tion the superfluous humour was thus\\n&quot; carried off, they perceived their strength\\n&quot; increase. And towards the latter part of\\n&quot;the time I have often observed with fur-\\n&quot; prise, that there appeared a more natural,\\n&quot;genuine, and copious sweat, than the for-\\n&quot; mer occasioned by the sudorific; which\\n&quot;gave greater relief, as if it were truly\\n&quot;critical, and terminated the disease. 3dly,\\n&quot;Again, I do not fee what inconveniency\\n&quot;would attend refreshing the patient with\\n&quot; restorative broths and liquids when the\\n&quot;sweat is at the height; and the objeion\\n&quot; of want of strength to bear long sweats\\n&quot;vanihes. If therefore a faintness be per-\\n&quot;ceived towards the end, I allow the pa-\\n&quot; tient to sup a little chicken broth, the\\n&quot;yolk of an egg, or the like; which to-\\n&quot; gether with the cordials and draughts,\\n&quot;usually direded to keep up the sweat,\\n&quot;sufficiently support the strength. But in\\n&quot;a matter of fad so evident, it is needless\\n&quot; to use many arguments; for what clearly\\n( thews the advantages of this method is,\\n\\n8 L&quot; that\\n\\n.C that.lhile the patient continues to ;sweat,\\n&quot;. he judges himself in a fair way of reco-\\n&quot;very,-and in the opinion of the attend-\\n\\nants. -seems in no farther danger.; bit\\n&quot; as soon as the sweat ceases, and the body\\n&quot;begins to dry, he grows worfe,-a kiln ocf\\n&quot;relapse being therebyoctafioned.&quot;\\n\\nArt. 45. &quot; For. 2,4 hours. after the sweat\\n&quot; is gone off, I advise the patient to be.oan-\\n&quot; tious of catching cold, to let his lineh\\n&quot; dry on his body,. take all his liquids\\n&quot; warm,: and also to- continue the use ds\\n&quot; the sage posset drink.\\n\\n&quot;Next; morning- I give the commd\\n&quot; purgee.;made of an.infufion of tamarind,\\n&quot; leaves of senna, rhubarb, with mann\\n( and folutive syrup of roses, dilfolved it\\ni&#x27;the strained liquor.

The great difference be-\\ntween there two plans of operation is, that by a dia-\\nphoretic regimen, time is given to perform cotion,\\nand a gradual expulsion of the offending matter:\\nwhereas, by a sudorific regimen, expulsion is performed\\nwithout waiting for coion: and this is the reason\\nwhy Sydenham was of opinion, that the morbid mat-\\nter of the most penetrating and subtile nature might\\nbe forced through the skin, even in a crude ate; but\\nthat all the morbid matter, of a more gross nature,\\nrequired a previous preparation before they could be\\nseparated from the blood, and made to pass through\\nthe pores of the kin.\\n\\nExperience however taught him to distinguish where\\nit might succeed, and where not; &#x27;and being very ac-\\ncurate in his observations, he found, that the sudorific\\nplan would never succeed in any one of the seven com-\\nmon fevers, till towards the conclusion, and after a\\ndue concoction; nor in the small-pox, measles, or\\nhooping cough; although they are of the contagious\\nfort, and might have been supposed very subtile: but\\nhe allo found, that it might succeed in the very be-\\nginning of the plague, and pcftilential fever for\\nwhich reason he concluded, that they were of a still\\nmore volatile. and subtile nature than those others:\\nhowever, towards the end, even of the pestilential fe-\\nver, he found it necefary to begin an antifcptic regi-\\nmen, and to purge off the grofler remaining part by\\nthe bowels; after having dillipatcd the more volatile\\n\\nVOL. II, I and\\n\\n&quot; ing, even in such as are not very apt to\\n&quot;sweat; apprehending the sudden death\\n&quot; of the patlunt might prevent the in.\\n&quot; tended sweat, from a return of the mor.\\n&quot; bific matter into the empty vessels*. Yet\\n\\nbleeding might perhaps be used safely\\nenough, provided a sweat were raised\\n&quot;immediately afterwards, which, being\\nc&#x27; continued for the space above-mentioned,\\n&#x27; may disperse and waste the whole mats\\n&quot; of the humor by degrees, and with\\n&quot; much less danger than would attend the\\n&quot; waiting a long time for a kindly fuppu-\\n&quot; ration of the imposthume, which is very\\n&quot;uncertain in so violent a disease.&quot;\\n\\nI have copied the whole of this passage\\nfrom Sydenham, because it expresses m\\nidea of the best method of treating the an\\ngina maligna; which is a peflilential con-\\ntagion so subtile as to be diffipable by\\nsweat in the very beginning, as will apper\\nby the cafes hereafter related. But it fre\\nand subtile part by a violent long sweat: at the faa\\ntime he was very cautious to keep up a gentle dis\\nphorcfis, for fear of drawing back any of the pefilenti\\nmiafinata from the circumference to the center; an\\ntherefore he advised the keeping warm, at the fam\\ntime that he ordered the purge and the antifepticr\\ngimen.\\n\\n* Sydenham has remarked in many parts of h\\nworks, that a sweat is more easily raised after bleedi\\nthan before it,\\n\\nquentll\\n\\nquently happens, in some constitutions, that Sweatca.\\nthis salutary sweat cannot be raised without beraifed\\na previous bleeding, of which I will give bithdou\\none instance out of many.\\n\\nA daughter of Mr. M. at Hoxton was\\nseized with the violent symptoms of a true\\nangina maligna; after the vomiting and purg-\\ning had fibfided, I endeavoured to raise a\\nsweat by the usual means; but after a trial\\nof o hours, I perceived the sweat would\\nnot flow; that the pulse became more hard,\\nthe skin flushed, and more dry; the anxiety\\nwas considerably infreafed, and he could\\nget no reft in any posture: I therefore or-\\ndered her to be blooded sufficiently, to mo-\\nderate the pulse and universal tension of the\\nvessels, which had the desired effect; for\\nin the space of an hour the symptoms\\nabated, and the sweat came on; which, be-\\ning properly promoted for the necessary\\ntime, proved truly critical.\\n\\nThis observation, however, has not efcap-\\ned Sydenham, 1. c. Art. 30. &quot; But though I\\n&quot; greatly approve of this method (i. e. the\\n&quot;antiphlogistic method), and have for-\\n&quot;merly experienced its usefulness in many\\ninstances ; yet, for several reasons, I\\n&quot;prefer the dissipation of the pestilential\\n&quot; ferment by sweat, to its evacuati, by\\n&quot; bleeding ; because sweating does not\\n&quot; weaken the patient so much, nor hazard\\n\\nI &quot; the\\n\\n&quot; the reputation of the physician. But\\n\\nthis, however, has its inconveniencies\\n&quot; too; for first in many, and efpecially&#x27;in\\n&quot; young persons of a hot constitution, a\\n&quot; sweat is not easily raised; and the more\\n\\u00b7 you endeavour to raise one in such sub-\\nL jeds, by heaping on clothes, and giving\\n&quot;powerful sudorifics,. so much the greater\\n&quot;danger there is of causing a delirium; or,\\n&quot;which is still worse, after having been\\n&#x27; deluded a while with vain expectations,\\n&quot; peftiiential spots (i. e. petechix) are at\\n&quot; length forced out, instead of sweat.&quot;\\n\\nI remember the time when I was afraid\\n*to promote a sweat in the beginning of a\\nfever, because it was contrary to my ideas\\nof the manner of treating common fevers;\\nin all which the early sweats seldom give\\nmuch relief. But experience has fully\\nconvinced me that Sydenham is right when\\nhe fays, &quot; That the sweat which agrees\\n&quot; with the epidemic fever, agrees alo with\\n&quot; the cncomitantfever; although the ae\\n(&#x27; fieat mnight be prejudicial in the comnmo\\n&quot;fever, if the contagion had not been fitpt\\nContJgious aidded.&quot; Now it is evident, that, by epit\\nfepidcby demnicfever here, Sydenham means to ex\\n&#x27;derha rn press the contagious fever, and todiftinguif\\n\\nit from the concomitant, common fever:\\nthe reason is plain; for, whenever a pefli&#x27;\\nlential contagion gets footing in a place, at\\n\\ncertain\\n\\ncertain seasons f the year, all the people\\nwhose constitution is predisposed, will pro-\\nbably catch it; and you will seldom fee a\\ncommon fever single, till the feaibn alters\\nso as to correct the contagion: and this is the\\nreason why other fevers are very rare while\\nthe plague rages ;an observation univer-\\nsally made by every body who treats of this\\ndilfemper: hence the contagious fever may\\nwell be called, the epidemic fever, as assed-\\ning by far the greater number; and the\\nsingle common fever of the season, will only\\nbe met with here and there, where the\\ncontagion has not spread *. But to return\\nto the angina maligna.\\n\\nThe propriety of dissipating the conta-sweating\\ngion by sweat, was very well known to hreswth\\nHuxham, Ang. Mal. p. 52. &quot; But I muftli&quot;g, .\\n&quot;confess, in general, much warmer medi-\\n&quot;cines were necessary in this than in most\\n&quot; other fevers; and that too sometimes\\n&quot; when the heat was very considerable,\\n&quot; otherwise the pulse would link furprif-\\n&quot;ingly, and an astonishing anxiety and\\n\\noppression immediately succeed. I have\\n&quot;really been obliged to give such warm\\n\\n*We ought not therefore to find such fault with\\nour climate, becaufc it is so variable; for this very\\nvariety is our greatest security against the fpreadina of\\ncntagious fevers, which are always more formidable\\nthan the common ones.\\n\\nI 3 &quot; alexi-\\n\\nA alexipharmics in this:diftemper (and that\\n&quot; too, many times, to very young persons)\\n\\nas nothing but repeated experience could\\n&quot; have induced me to order; as, saffron,\\n\\ncamphire, contrayerva, consea. cardiac,\\n&quot; theriac, warm cyder, mulled wine and\\n&quot;water, tina. cort. alexiphar. &amp;c. and\\n&quot; this with a success that was well known,\\n$&quot; and jultified the practice t,&quot;\\n\\nWhen\\n+ But at the fame time that Huxham found the hot\\nvegetable substances and wine so necessary in this fe-\\nver, he observed that alcaline salts, and flrong animal\\nfood did great mischief, both in this, and in all pefli-\\nlential fevers; 1. c. p. 57. G, Volatile alcalious salts,\\n&quot; it is certainly fa&amp;, that given internally they heai\\n&#x27; more, quantity for quantity, than the warmest vege\\n&quot; table alexipharmics. And that 1 think, not\\n&lt; much by increasing the projeaile force and circu\\n&quot; lation of the blood, as by causing an intestine mno\\n, tion and effenrvefcence in it; for, by the most accu\\n&quot; rate experiments, it is found that folutlons of tht\\n&quot; alcaline salts weaken the tone of the fibres, ani\\n&quot; power of the vessels, and confcqucntly the momen\\nc tumn of the blood, in the regular course of circu\\n\\nlation. And we eventually find, that, when thl\\n&quot; blood abounds with very acrid salts, the pulse be\\n&quot; comes weak, small, quick and fluttering, as\\n&quot;the highly scorbutic; and that corrupt, acrimoni\\n\\nous slate of blood, which brings on the putri\\ns&#x27; fever, antecedent to some mortifications ab intrf\\n&quot; aufa.&quot; &amp;c. &amp;c.

But if this salutary\\nsweat was pushed too violently beyond a\\ncertain degree; or kept up for too great a\\nlength of time; then they complained of\\n\\nbecoming\\n\\nbecoming low, languid, and even faint;\\nthey lothed vituals, and became sick after\\nit. So long as the sweat was salutary, the\\npulse became more flow and full, with an\\nabatement of all the symptoms; but after\\nthe sweat had had its full effect, then the\\npulse became again more quick, and new\\nfyimptoms appeared, which perhaps had\\nnever existed before; in that cafe it became\\nnecessary to procure free passage by stool;\\nto make the diet more antiieptic, and dimi-\\nnifh tle quantity of sudorifics; but not en-\\ncourage exposing the body to the cold air.\\n\\n2dly, At any period of the distemper, avomits\\nvomit always agreed, when there were evi- agree with\\ndent signs of turgid matter in the stomach;\\nand this operation rather promoted than\\nretarded the diaphoresis *.\\n\\n3dly, If, at the very beginning of thePurging\\n\\nwhenpro-\\ndisease, there were evident symptoms of per.\\nmuch turgid matter in the bowels, a clyster\\nor gentle purge became necessary; other-\\nwife it was better deferred till after the\\nsweat had taken effet; which frequently\\nremoved the little uneasy feelings in the\\nbowels.\\n\\n* All the emetic drugs, particularly such as are\\nprepared from antimony, given in small doses, have a\\ndiaphoretic quality.\\n\\n4thly,\\n2\\n\\ntIeed:ng 4thly, If symptoms of real inflammation\\nwhen necef-\\nfary. attended the first attack, bleeding always\\n\\ngave relief, and assisted the diaphoretics.\\nStupes of Sthly, I never found occasion for alca-\\n\\nlines of any kind to raise the iweat; but\\nfluping the legs with flannels wrung out of\\nhot vinegar and water were often service-\\nable.\\nAntiphlo- 6thly, When an high antiphlogiflic me-\\nthod, detri- thod had been adopted, and persisted in for\\nrental. any considerable length of time, the disease\\n\\nbecame anomalous, tedious, and dangerous;\\nthe few that escaped with their lives had a\\nbad recovery, and remained long weak\\nand languid.\\nAntihrntic 7thly, When, previous to the sweat, an\\n,nethth its\\ntae,. antiseptic method had been adopted in the\\n\\nvery beginning, and persisted in through-\\nout, the sick frequently escaped with their\\nlives: but the disease was always protracted,\\nand for the mofl part there remained a\\nhardness and swelling of the tonfis for fe-\\nveral weeks, nay sometimes ever after;\\nbut if the sweat preceded the antiseptic me-\\nthod, and the diaphoresis was properly kept\\nup afterwards, the disease went off in seven\\ndays; and none of those swellings followed\\nin confecuence of it, though the antifeptik\\nmethod had been persised in to the end.\\nMl;jrv {]i&#x27;ly, A great fluflhing in the skin and\\n.,ellns fiweilin in thle hands and fingers were fr&#x27;\\n\\nUC qucr^I,\\n\\nquent, particularly during the spring sea-\\nson; but.thefe symptoms however were not\\nformidable, because they went off with the\\ncritical sweat, and required no particuldr\\nalteration in the treatment. But when to\\nthere was added an eruption of a white imi-\\nliary rash, it portended great acrimony of\\nthe humors, and a tedious, dangerous fe-\\nver: in this situation the high antiphlogif-\\ntic treatment brought on a retrocession of\\nthe eruption, soon followed by a fuffoca-\\ntion *. Strong sudorifics increased the\\nacrimony, and brought on a putrid fevert.\\nWhat succeeded the best was a mild anti-\\nfcptic method, something like what has\\nbeen recommended in the bilious fever, and\\na diet such as has been prescribed in the\\nfynochus non putris, with the addition of\\nbark: I think the camphor much diluted\\nwas of fervicc; it seemed to operate as an\\nanodyne here, just as it is said to do in\\n\\n* Tiffot, Avis au Peuple, se&amp;t. 120.

But\\nfinding upon the 26th that he was rather\\nworse than he had been on any of the for-\\nmer days, he desired my assistance.\\n\\nI saw her first late at night; she seemed\\ninclinable to sleep; her pulse beat I3o, soft,\\nand very small; her skin was hot and mot-\\ntled; mouth foul, but not very dry; I could\\nnot fee down into the throat that night;\\nthe belly was tense and swelled, although\\nshe had had ome little, foetid, dark co-\\nloured tfools; both parotid and fulbmaxil-\\nlary glands were swelled; but she remained\\nfenfible,-and tradable.\\n\\nI ordered her belly to be fomented with\\nflannels out of hot vinegar and water; to\\ngive a little draught every fix hours, with\\nfour drops of the ipir. fulph. per camp. in\\n\\neach;\\n7\\n\\neach; to acidulate her drink with ome\\ndrops of the fame spirit; to give her plenty\\nof thin, soft, nourishing sippings, and to\\nthrow up a clyster.\\nJuly 27.

He had no reft in the night, his\\nbreathing became difficult, and the inside\\nof his throat was now covered with as ash-\\ncoloured slough, and almost quite closed by\\nthe greatness of the swelling in both ton-\\nfils, both parotids, all the sublingual and\\nsubmaxillary glands: the kin was intense-\\nly hot and red, and the pulse hard, full,\\nand quick; but he had not sweated. I or-\\ndered him to be blooded, and persist in the\\nfame method as before. Soon after the\\nbleeding, a sweat came on, and was pro-\\nmoted as much as could safely be done in\\nsuch a cafe; but it could not be kept up,\\nfor in the evening the kin became dry, and\\nall the symptoms increased, with a wheez-\\ning respiration, and a distention of the\\nbelly. I ordered a purging clyster to be\\ninjected, and to repeat the former draught\\nwith the addition of 8 grains of nitre: in-\\ndeed I would have given him an antimo-\\nnial vomit, but the passage in the throat\\nwas so narrow that I was deterred from it.\\nAfter a plentiful stool he was again reliev-\\ned, and I expected the sweat might then\\ncome on, especially as he seemed mote\\nquiet and to have lcfs of the anxiety.

In this si-\\ntuation I thought it necessary to bleed. h:i\\nagain, and accordingly ordered 6 ounces to\\nbe taken away ; which was still more.fizy\\nthan the former: this gave immniediate re-\\nlief, the skin became moist, &quot; prodigious\\neruption came out all over the whole body,\\nboth hands and feet were very much swell-\\ned, and the pulse&#x27; became soft, but not\\nsmall; the breathing also became easier;\\nbut the swallowing was more difficult, or\\nhe more averse to drinking. Thefame me-\\ndicines were continued.\\n\\n17th, It was evident this mortiing, that\\nnature had made a push to the circumfe-\\nrence, and. thereby had relieved both the\\npulse and breathing; ; but although the flin\\nhad now and then been moist, yet there\\nnever had been that kindly critical sweat,\\nwhich is usual i this fever on or before the\\n5th day : the difliicnlty in swallowing was\\nformidable, and the swellings were very\\ngreat: I was not able to fee into the throat,\\nbecause he could hardly open his mouth,\\n\\nN but\\n\\nbutI had great reason to fufpea that the\\nfauces were in a very bad situation. I or-\\ndered a blister to be put round the throat\\nfrom ear to ear; to proceed with the fame\\ndraught; to use a sub-acid gargle often,\\nand to stupe the feet and legs with flannels\\nwrung out of hot water and vinegar,\\n\\n8th. The operations of last night gave\\nsome relief; he swallowed better, the pulse\\n:continued soft, not small, and in quickness\\n-only - o; the eruptions were fill out and\\nprominent; he could open his mouth and\\nswallow better&#x27;; the breathing was not so\\nbad; I could now fee that the tonsils and\\nveil of the palate were gangrened; but the\\ntongue was moist, and not very foul; he\\nalso slavered a little, but his nose was much\\nfluffed.

The fever returned in the night\\nas usual with the delirium and former\\nsymptoms; but towards morning he had a\\nvery large soft stool, and the delirium sub-\\nfided: we could now perceive that the\\nmouth was foul, and the palate covered\\nwith a thick, brown aphthous cruft: he\\nalso had a great discharge of offensive ichor\\nfom the nose; but he avered very little;\\nt e pulse however kept up, he took a rea-\\n\\nN 3 fonable\\n\\nfonable quantity of nourishment&#x27; and his\\nmedicines regularly: his urine wasjumen-\\nto, and his skin hot, dry and scurfy.\\n\\nift. The fever and delirium returned\\nin the night with double violence, but\\nabated again in the morning; then he\\ncomplained of the pain in his throat and all\\nover his body: I examined his skin, and\\nfound the eruption was scaling off; I could\\nnot perceive any vibices, molopes, phlyc-\\ntene, or petechi ; but on both elbows there\\nwere two large, irregular, dry, gangrenous\\nspots; and several lesser efchars on diffe-\\nrent parts of the body; yet where the blif-\\nters had been applied looked very well, and\\ndischarged properly: his breathing was\\nnot worse, the pulse fill kept up, was\\nsoft, and IIo in a minute: his mouth was\\nmoist, but very foul; the aphthe did not\\nseparate kindly; and the nose discharged\\nvery much; the flench was now greatly\\nincreased in spite of all that could be done\\nto prevent it; and the disease was become\\ntruly putrid as well as malignant. The\\nswelling of the parotids was very great and\\nprominent; to them poultices were applied\\nin hopes of bringing them to a fuppura-\\ntion; the fame medicines were continued,\\nwith the addition of more wine in his diet.\\n\\n22d.

All the bad symptoms remained,\\nthe pulse began to fail, and he made water\\ninsensibly: the gangrenes were spread on\\nboth elbows, as well as on the tops of the\\nthigh bones, where I believe it was fphace-\\nlated to the bone: he seemed always drow-\\nfy, and very fretful when disturbed: we\\ncould not examine the inside of his mouth,\\nbut had reason to believe it was in a very.\\nbad ituation; his nurse, however, got him\\nto take his diet and medicines. It was\\njudged necessary to procure him a free pas-\\nsage, and then to proceed with the former\\ndraught, julep, and antiseptic cordial diet.\\n\\n24th. The purge gave him a large, ill-\\neoloured, very offensive stool; for which\\nreason, it was again repeated. We pro-\\nceeded thus, opening the body from time\\nto time, and supporting him regularly with\\nall the antiseptic diet and medicines, both\\nexternal and internal, we could think of;\\nbut fill we gained no ground, for the gan-\\ngrenes spread daily more and more, and he\\ndied on the evening of the 28th of April,\\nbeing the 6th day of the whole fever.\\n\\nDuring the course of this fever, the ex-\\nacerbation in the evenings, and remiflion\\nthrough the days, were very mnifeft till\\n\\nN 4 after\\n\\nafter the 9th day; after which the fever\\nbecame more irregular; it seemed as if the\\nJj&#x27;nochus non putris had gradually degene-\\nrated into a i&#x27;nochus putris; and the blood,\\nwhich had been fizy in the beginning, was\\ngradually difrlved; or (as Sydenham ex-\\npresses it) broken asunder by the rays of\\nthe distemper; to which the malignant\\nmiafJmata had greatly contributed.\\nC A S E X.

Simple.\\ncre of Mr s. P. D. a firong, healthy, young\\nP. D. woman, regular and temperate in her man-\\n\\nner of living; was seized with the true an-\\ngina maligna. Upon the 8th of June, I770,\\nshe was immediately put on the diaphoretic\\nmethod; but because the weather was\\nwarm, ffe could not submit to be confined\\nin bed during the day-time. The confe-\\nquence was, that although she perspired in\\nthe night, yet this perspiration was flopped\\nevery morning; and the fever increased so\\nmuch on the oth as to become very feri-\\nous, when I first saw her. From that day,\\nhowever, she remained quiet in bed, and\\nsweated profusely for 24 hours. On the\\n\\n2th, fe was purged with the ptisan: on\\nthe 3th, at night, flhe had the natural re-\\nturn of the catamenia, which proved quite\\ncritical; for the free gentle perspiration\\ncontinued without the aid of medicine, and\\nfhc was perfecly well in three days. Which\\nconfirms what I have fiequently observed,\\n\\nvqiz,\\n\\nviz. That the natural return of an habitual\\nevacuation, is a salutary symptom.\\n\\nC A S E XVII.

Upon te Sth,\\nihe was taken out in a chariot in the middle\\nof te day, for an airing, and thought he\\nwas revived by it. At night, however, all\\nthe symptoms returned with double vio-\\nlence, and increased the gth all day and\\nnight. Upon the oth, in the morning,\\nshe was purged, and the acids increased in\\nher sippings, but to no purpose; for in the\\nevening, when I firfi saw her, I found her\\npulse irregular, small, and exceeding fft;\\nher breathing was difficult, and attended\\nwith a disagreeable wheezing; her nose was\\nfluffed, and dilcharged a fotiu, ichorous\\nmatter; he could not speak, nor fwallowv\\nbut with the utnioft difficulty. I ordercd\\noilne warm nourifllinent to be injeted fre-\\nquently in finall quantitics by clyfler; to\\n\\nIlay\\n\\nlay a blifer round the throat froni ear to\\near: to endeavour to get down a fudorifid\\nmedicine, with camphor julep, and spirit of\\nlea alt, and to fiupe her legs with flannels\\nout of hot oxycrate.

G-n is a firong hard working man, cae of s\\nabout 40 years of age; in the beginningG-~n.\\nof June he was seized with a cold sliver-\\ning fit, succeeded by great heat and fever,\\nwith pain in his head and back; for which\\nhe was blooded immediately; a sweat fol-\\nlowed, and-the fever subsided: his tongue\\nhowever remained foul, his pulse a little\\nquick, and he complained of a disorder in\\nhis itomach all the next day; for which\\nhe took a brifl vomit: the following day\\nthe cold fit returned, fuccceded by a hot\\nfit and fwcating, tb that it evidently was a\\n\\nformed\\n\\nformed and regular tertian: during the fe-\\ncond interval he was purged gently; but\\nafter the third fit he took a very brisk dose\\nof physic, which carried off the ague alto-\\ngether: however, he loft a good deal of his\\nfiefh and colour.\\n\\nIri this situation he went to fee his chil-\\ndren,. at that time ill of the angina maligna;\\nwhich he caught of them. On the oth\\nof June he complained of great faintness,\\nloss of strength and spirits; his pulse was\\nfunk very much, his hands swelled, his\\nskin was covered with an eruption of the\\nmiliary kind; the tonsils were swelled and\\ncovered with many specks. He began the\\ndiaphoretic medicines, drank a good deal\\nof wine and lemon-juice in all his sippings,\\nand was kept constantly in bed; on the d\\nday the sweat came on, and relieved him\\nvery much; but still the pulse remained\\nlanguid, and his spirits were depressed; the\\nulcers also continued to spread. A large\\nblifler was put all round his throat from\\near to ear, the draughts and diet were con-\\ntinued, and a camphor julep with spirit of\\nsea salt was given between the draughts.\\n\\nThese remedies were perfified in, with a\\nreflorative antiseptic regimen, for 4 days;\\nduring all which time he perspired freely.\\nUpon the morning of the 7th day from\\nthe attack, he was purged with rhubarb,\\n\\nand\\n\\nand then began the bark in large doses,\\nalong with the acid mixture, which oon\\nremoved the whole fever, healed the ulcers,\\nand restored his pulse and appetite: but he\\nwas obliged to continue the bark and re-\\nftoratives for a fortnight longer, before he\\nrecovered his usual strength and colour.\\n\\nSoon after this the putrid conititution\\nbegan, and the angina maligna was blended\\nwith it, in the fame way it had been the\\npreceding year already described. About\\nthe end of August, however, it subsided\\nconsiderably; for although it began with\\ngriping and purging, yet, after one dose of\\nphysic, thee symptoms commonly went off;\\nafter which a salutary sweat was readily\\nbrought on with great and good effe&amp;.\\nOne example will clear up this matter bet-\\nter than a long dissertation.\\n\\nCASE XX.\\nOn the 23d of August, 1770, MaRser S,.Ce o;\\nR. a strong healthy child was seized with a Maftc&quot;St\\nfever, and griping in his bowels during\\nthe night; he was purged early the fol-\\nlowing morning, which relieved him very\\nmuch: he continued however drooping\\nall day, and complained very much of his\\nhead and throat: upon examination, the\\n\\nVOL. II. P tonfilt\\n\\ntonsils were much enlarged, and covered\\nwith many specks; he was immediately\\nput into a warm bed, and began the &#x27;dia-\\nphoretic medicines and regimen; the sweat\\ncame on that evening, and he was well in\\nthree days after.\\n\\nI saw several such cafes in September,\\nwhich all yielded easily to a similar treat-\\nment. In October, the disease was not so\\ncommon, at least I did not happen to meet\\nwith it so often; but it seemed to revive\\nagain in December and several people sus-\\nsered by it: upon the I 3th of this month,\\nI was sent for to fee a gentleman&#x27;s son, at\\na boarding school near town, which was\\nthen breaking up for the holidays; ome\\nof the children had been sent home ill, and\\nothers fell sick soon after they arrived at\\ntheir fathers houses.\\n\\nC A S E XXL\\narse of December Iz, 1770, Master T---d, a\\n\\n. firong healthy child, very lusty, and of a\\n\\nruddy complexion; early in the morning,\\nhe was seized with a smart cold fit, which\\nlasted some hours, and was succeeded by\\na confider-ble degree of heat; he relied\\nvery ill all that night, and rambled and\\nfiarted continually; he could not eat any\\n\\nthing,\\n\\nthing, but draik. a great deal of very mall\\nwine whey.\\n\\nI3th. I saw him at seven i the evening,\\nand found his pulse so quick that I could\\nhardly count it&#x27;; his eyes were greatly in-\\nflamed, his kin hot, and all over red; the\\nangles f the jaw much iwelled, the ton-\\nfils much enlarged and covered with many\\nspecks; but he had no fieknefs at his fio-\\nmach, nor pain in his bowels; nor was his\\ntongue loaded, although it was white.\\n\\nI ordered some blood to be taken from\\nhis arm, and to begin a diaphoretic course\\ndiredlyr; but, if the sweat did not come on\\nbefore morning, to stupe his legs with flan-\\nnels wrung out of hot oxycrate; at the\\nfame time to cover him up, to continue the\\nsmall whey, and to add common oxymel to\\nall his sippings.\\n\\nI4th. The medicines were given as di-\\nreaed all night, and the sweat came on be-\\nfore the filrgeon came to bleed him; he\\ntherefore was not blooded, but he drank\\nplentifully, and continued to sweat freely;\\nhis pulse was now greatly mended; his\\nhead much relieved, his eyes less inflamed,\\n&#x27;le swellings round the jaw diminilhed,\\nhis body was covered with an eruption with\\nvWhite heads, (purpura alba) the tonsils re-\\nmained enlarged, but many of the soughs\\nt&#x27;ere fallen off, which left the throat very\\n\\nP 2, tender;\\n\\ntender; he had a plentiful stool towards\\nmorning. The fame medicines were con-\\ntinued, and I charged the nurse to supply\\nhim plentifully with warm liquors, al-\\nthough he complained much of the pain in\\nSwallowing.\\n\\nI5th. He drank plentifully during the\\nnight, and perspired freely; he had two\\ngood stools also, but the eruption on the\\nskin was more prominent, although the\\nredness was not so great: the pulse was\\nmuch mended, the mouth and throat were\\npretty clean, but excoriated: he had some\\nappetite for food, and eat bread pudding ac-\\ncordingly. As the sweat had given so much\\nrelief, and seemed to remove the malignity\\nof this formidable and contagious fever, I\\nthought it prudent to promote this evacu-\\nation gently, and not to susser his being\\ntaken out of bed; accordingly I wrote the\\nfollowing prescription for him:\\n\\nR Aq. alexit. ifpl.

All that\\ndady &#x27;passeid without the patient&#x27;s making\\nany complaiit. On Monday&#x27;there appeared\\na tumor--:fituated externally near to the\\nttracheal arter:y: then the patient had a lit-\\nile fever, which increased in the evening:\\nthey applied :upon the tumor a cataplasm\\n*of bread and&#x27;milk, and as he complained\\nof:her throa-t, they made her use a gargle,\\nIbmetiiies of syrup of mulberries, some-\\ntimes a decodion of figs boiled in milk.\\nOn Tuesday the family sent for one of the\\nbrothers of the charity, who direted a\\nbleeding at the arm, which bleeding dimi-\\nhifhed the fever. On Wednesday they\\nthought ihe had a cold in her head, for her\\nnose was flopped: they pretend she had no\\nfever: they did not examine the throat,\\nnor had they any uneasiness on her ac-\\ncount. On Thursday the was purged with\\n\\ntwo\\n\\n-w6 t\\u00f3rees of-:-anna, and one drachm &#x27;of\\nrhubarb; the medicine was regurgitated.\\nOn Friday she was greatly stopped up, &#x27;and\\nspoke very nruch through her nose. On\\nthe Saturday her voice was much inter-\\nrupted, and -he rattled (or had rather a\\nwhizzing noise) in her breath: she seemed\\nftragled, and notwithflanding this, as she\\nfvwalowed well they did not yet examine\\nthe throat. On Sunday the strangling was\\naccompanied with a fuffocationi; the fever\\nincreasing every moment, they sent in the\\nevening for the -house physician, who ad-\\nvised to bleed in the foot. On Monday the\\nacceleration and increase of the fever deter-\\nmined the physician to reiterate the bleeding\\nin the foot twice in that morning: then they\\nexamined the throat, and found it full of\\nwhitish efchars, which seemed to scale and\\npeel off. They endeavoured to separate\\nthem: then her voice wholly failed, and\\nthe fell into the agonies of death, and died\\nat eight o&#x27;clock on Tuesday morning.

The\\nfamily to whom she belonged was apprised\\nof it the fame day, and she was kept very\\nsimple both as to diet and drink. On the\\nTuesday there was observed a little feverish\\ncommotion, and her voice began to change.\\nOn the Wednesday she was in the fame\\nsituation. On the Thursday she was bled\\nin the arm, and the blood appeared quite\\nmelted (i. e. broken) and blackish; but\\nfrom this appearance of the blood no dia-\\ngnoflic can be formed of the disease; because\\nthe patient had been for ome months\\ntroubled with the green sickness; and on\\nthis account perhaps it was, that he was\\nthe more violently seized; because we know\\nthat very frequently the green sickness is\\naccompanied with a kind of hectic fever.\\nOn the Friday the patient was under a\\ngreat dejetion, (un grand abatement) with\\ngreat difficulty in swallowing, a little cough,\\n\\nand\\n\\nand a kind of rattling in the breast, like\\nthat made in the throat by gargling. With\\nwhat rapidity did the gangrene proceed!\\non the Saturday the fever did not appear\\nincreased; then her throat was examined\\nfor the. first time; at which time they\\nfound the almonds and palate, or uvula,\\ncovered with whitiih .efchars of a deadifh\\nappearance, and seemingly disposed to loof-\\nen: they endeavoured to extirpate (separate\\nor take away) the gangrened flesh.\\n\\n&quot; On Sunday the fever kept much as it\\nwas, without any increase or augmentation.\\nAt noon the patient was blooded in the\\nfoot: In the afternoon they were employed\\nin endeavouring what they could to loosen\\nfrom the bottom of the throat the gangre-\\nnous sloughs or efchars. At ten o&#x27;clock that\\nevening, the patient had a great languor\\nand weakness, followed by an universal\\ncold, ( suppose our author means hiver-\\ning) all over her body, to which succeeded\\na violent fever. At midnight he was blood-\\ned in the foot. At two o&#x27;clock they put\\non blisters. At four bled her in the throat;\\nthen they tried again to separate the gan-\\ngrened and dead from the live parts. On\\nMonday, at noon, he died.\\n\\nCASE\\n\\n:CA &quot;E III.\\ncc Mirs Danlezy, aged 13 years, was\\ntaken, on Sunday the 2oth of the fame\\nmonth, with a fore throat, at four o&#x27;clock\\nin the afternoon. A fright had seized her\\nsome days before; at&#x27;8 o&#x27;clock she was bled\\nin the arm. Monday morning at 4 o&#x27;clock,\\nthe bleeding in the arm was repeated: at 9\\no&#x27;clock -hey advised a bleeding in the foot,\\nin hopes to flop the progress of a diftem-\\nper, which with great reason appeared very\\nterrifying: the bleeding in the foot was\\nreiterated at four o&#x27;clock in the afternoon,\\nand again at eight at night. Tuesday, M.\\nVernage and M. Boyer again advised two\\nmore bleedings in the foot; notwithitanding\\nwhich the patient had a considerable bleed-\\ning at the nose, and the pituitary mem-\\nbrane became gangrenous. They used\\ngargles, the basis of which was honey of\\nroses and spirit of vitriol. They acidulat-\\ned her drink a little with the spirit of ful-\\nphur; her broths were light, soft, and\\ntemperate. They applied different cata-\\nplafnls, -of the difiblving, dilcuffive, and\\nemollient kind, to the throat, and above all\\nfwallows-neft: over and above the ordi-\\nnary gargles, they made a digestive with\\nspirit of turpentine, spirit of fcurvy-grafs,\\n\\nthe\\n\\nthe collyrium of Lanfranc, ad yolks of\\neggs, .and touched the efchars with.apled-\\nget. They also ufed&#x27;a. gargle of the Bala-\\nruch waters: they tried theire different re-\\nmedics. by turns, bechaufe they observed,\\nwith much concern, that nothing in the\\nleast fiopt the progress. of the gangrene,\\nhow:flharp or aive soever, nor had, (by\\nwhat they could perceive) any effea c pon\\nthe sick, nor was there any thing but the\\ngargle of the juice of&#x27;citrons, .which seemed\\nin the leafi to roufe..Nature, or make her\\nsensible of pain. On Wednesday, the ob-\\nftinacy of the symptoms, the bleedings at\\nthe nose, and the stoppage therein, and the\\nfever induced them again, for the 8th time,\\nto bleed her in the foot: in the afternoon,\\nunknown to the physicians, they gave her\\na potion compoed of the confection of hy-\\nacinth, the confection of alkermes, and\\nsyrup of lemons in some cordial waters. In\\nthe evening, the patient being just inflatu\\nquo, Messrs. Vernage and Boyer advised a\\nvomit, which was taken in the night, with\\na view, by evacuating (or cleansing) the\\nfirst paflages, to lessen the putrefaction.\\nThe evacuation was considerable upwards\\nand downwards, and in what was brought\\noff the itomach, there were seen floating,\\nseveral pieces of cfchars, but the evacuation\\nby stool was blaciilh: by this method they\\n\\nfccmed\\n\\nseemed to think her somewhat better, and\\nthe vomit was continued all Thursday; but\\nit was a chip in pottage, and to no pur-\\npose. Thursday evening, notwithstanding\\nthe abundance of the humours evacuated,\\nthe gangrene increased daily: one slough\\nor efchar fell off, and another was observed\\nto succeed in the fame place, and more ex-\\ntended in breadth. When any one came\\nnear the sick, they were seized with a\\ndreadful ltench: from the two nofirils there\\ndropt a very harp and corrosive ferofity,\\n(i. e. ichor). The tongue was neither dry,\\nblack, burnt, or parched, the sick in perfect\\nsenses, her eyes good, and in their natural\\nslate: rather a vivacity than irregularity in\\nthe pulse; the urine good, in large quan-\\ntity, but crude. In this situation they tried\\nthe syrup of quinquina, (bark) to flop if\\npossible the progress of the putrefaction;\\nwhich medicine they continued on the Fri-\\nday, rendering it somewhat purgative. On\\nSaturday she was so flopped up, that she was\\nscarcely heard when he spoke: her smell\\nwas insupportable, and, notwithstanding all\\nthe bleeding, he bled at different times (cr\\nhad different fits of bleeding) at her note.\\nOn Sunday, at fix in the morning, she died.\\nN. B. It is worthy observation, that during\\nthe whole time he swallowed well.\\n\\nCASE\\n\\nCASE IV.\\n&quot;Miss de Bonac the youngest, aged 2\\nyears and an half, appeared to be out of\\norder upon Sunday the oth of Ocober;\\nshe had complained of a pain in her ear,\\n(or the ear-ach) for two or three days: her\\nnights were disturbed and bad. At four\\no&#x27;clock in the afternoon, he had a little\\nfever; on the next day in the afternoon,\\nin examining the bottom of the mouth,\\nthey perceived an aphtha or white spot on\\none of the almonds (or tonsils); and this\\nwas constantly observed, that in all those\\nthat had the distemper, these spots appear-\\ned in 24 hours from the seizure, and spread\\ninstantaneously. She was bled in the arm,\\nand on Tuesday the bleeding was repeated:\\nOn Wednesday they gave her a vomit, and\\non Thursday Kermes&#x27; mineral, the Friday\\na vomit. Notwithstanding this, the disease\\ngained ground in an inexpressible degree:\\nthe efchars filled, and as it were choaked\\nup the bottom of the throat, and were near\\nof the colour of a piece of hog&#x27;s lard: the\\nreft of the mouth was in a good ltate, the\\ntongue moist, the lips of a vermilion co-\\nlour, the eyes very good, no delirium;\\nwalking about; asking for victuals; fwal-\\nlowing easily; and as to fools, the fame as\\n\\nin\\n\\nin perfec health: they could never per-\\nfuade her to use any kind of gargle what-\\never; nor any drink, whether ptisan, le-\\nmonade, &amp;c. nor would he susser the\\napplication of the cataplasm of swallows-\\nnest, or even that which was most com-\\nmonly used of white bread and milk. She\\nhad the fame bad smell as the reft: on Sa-\\nturday they did nothing by way of remedy,\\nand seemed to give the little patient up;\\nand on Sunday, at one o&#x27;clock, he died.\\nOn opening the corps, we found the uvula\\nor palate eaten, the almonds ulcerated and\\nfchirrous, the lungs in part gangrened, and\\nin part filled with a purulent sanies.\\n\\nCASE V.\\n&quot; Miss Parquette, aged I2 years, ob-\\nserved some heat in her throat. On Mon-\\nday, the 2ft of Oaober, the palate was\\nlengthened and hanging down: at nine\\no&#x27;clock at night, he was bled in the arm:\\nfrom the Tuesday morning, the aphtha,\\nor white spots, appeared on one of the\\nglands or almonds: that fame day he was\\ntwice bled in the foot. Wednesday, he\\ntook a vomit, which operated largely both\\nupwards and downwards, and in what was\\nthrown up was observed some membranous\\n* 7 and\\n\\nand whitish substance, which fwaam and\\nthis happened though the efchars at the\\nbottom of the throat appeared the fame;\\nwhich, gave room to believe they came from\\nlower parts: The fools were black, and\\nvery foetid. At night (or evening) the\\nbleeding of the foot was reiterated, on aco\\ncount of a bleeding at the nose which hap-\\npened to her; yet was not the fever conli-\\nderable, nor the blood either coueneux, (by\\nwhich he means, I suppose, concave in its\\nsurface) or inflamed; but of a deep red,\\nand little dissolved, as was observed in all\\nthe reft. On Thursday they repeated the\\nvomit, under the form of mineral waters,\\nand with success. On Friday they confined\\nthemselves. to observation, prescribing no-\\nthing: small beverages of lemonade, and\\nbroths, mixt with juice of aperitive and\\ntemperating herbs were employed: as for\\nthe reft, not forgetting emollient clyflers\\nand acid gargles, and dissolving cataplasms,\\nas ufual.-On Saturday he was purged\\nwith cassia and manna: this medicine had\\ngreat effect. The efchars fell from the\\nthroat, and (contrary to the others) left no\\nnew ones to succeed : it is true indeed, that\\nthose of this patient had been more super-\\nficial than the others; nor did she speak\\nthrough the nose, neither did her nose run\\nichor, like the others; and .he was of a\\n\\nvery\\n\\nvery delicate constitution, and therefore; in\\nconsequence, had less matter to invite or\\nfeed contagion. The uvula fill kept hang-\\ning down ome time. Sunday pafled pure\\nwell, and Monday he was repurged with\\nsuccess, whence they judged her in a mend-\\ning way, which accordingly happened.\\nMr. Vernage was her physician in ordi-\\nnary.\\n\\nCASE VI.\\n&quot; Miss Jumillac, aged 15 years, was\\ndeclared ill on Monday the 2 ft of the fame\\nmonth. She had been indisposed several\\ndays; but as it was at a critical time, they\\ndid nothing: he passed this time very un-\\neasily, with great disquietude. Fear seized\\nher, and he complained of a little heat at\\nher throat: the had no fever; but yet as\\nshe was very fat and plethoric, she was\\nbled at the arm as soon as they could. In\\nthe night between Tuesday and Wednef-\\nday, the disease ihewed itself, and arrived\\nat such a height, that on the Wednesday\\nmorning, the efchars or sloughs, at the\\nbottom of the throat, those on the palate,\\nuvula, and tonsils or almonds, were confi-\\nderable, and already whitish in their ap-\\npearance, with this difference though, that\\n\\n4 the\\n\\nshe did not breath any fetor, and that her\\ntongue (which in all the other patients\\nwere somewhat swelled at the bottom or\\ntowards the root) was not only much more\\nso, but was otherwise remarkable for two\\nor three superficial ulcers, which daily eat\\nthrough the outward kin of the tongue.\\nOn Wednesday she was bled in, the foot,\\nand a little after they gave her a vomit,\\nand at night they bled her again in the\\nfoot. Hitherto, though the disease was\\npretty evere in the throat, there was no\\nfever, or very little observable; but it now\\nbegan to hew itself. On Tuesday the vo-\\nmit was repeated, with intention not only\\nto deftrcy the cause of so manifest a putre-\\nfaction; but also by the jolt or hock of the\\nacion of vomiting, to loosen such portions\\nof the efchars; which, though they seemed\\nfixed to nothing, yet were out of the reach\\nof instruments, hould they have judged\\nproper to have used them. The illness\\ngained ground daily, with great rapidity:\\nand then the little success that bleedings or\\nvomits had been of, made recourse be had\\nto other different remedies; sometimes giv-\\ning her treacle water, ometimes the vola-\\ntile spirit of vipers: and it was likewise\\nthought proper to make a diversion of the\\nhumor, towards the skin; to which end,\\nbllters were applied to the nape of the\\n\\nVOL. II. Q neck,\\n\\nneck, on the Thursday evening; and the\\nbelly appearing swelled, though not pain-\\nful, through extension, they tried to give\\nit eaie&#x27;by.a vomit, but in vain. On Fri-\\nday morning, by the effea of that blister\\nwhich had eat into the Ikin, the throat ap-\\npeared unfwelled, and there was a greater\\nfreedom in swallowing; because MifsJumil-\\nlac had ome symptoms which none of the\\nreft had; viz. that the almonds (or tonsils)\\nwere swelled, that she had pain in swallow-\\ning, and that frequently even her drink\\ncame up again through her nose. On\\nFriday evening, they applied blisters afrehi;\\nbecause that, from that afternoon, the skin\\nbeing dried, afforded no more evacuation\\nthat way; and the flesh coloured of a sus-\\npicious grey appearance. On Saturday the\\nblisters were dressed, but he hardly felt it.\\nOn Sunday, he was extremely bad. :Her\\nbreast began to be uneasy; nevertheless,\\nthey tried a vomit of ipecacuanna, which\\nbrought away ome membranous appear-\\nances, but without any diminution of the\\nsymptoms, the violence of which had never\\nbeen lessened indeed by any remedy that\\nhad been tried. In effea, the putrefation\\nwas so general, that from the Saturday\\nevening, gangrenous spots appeared about\\nthe os sacrum, and she died in the night\\nbetwixt Tuesday and Wednesday. Thro&#x27;\\n\\n6 the\\n\\nthe whole of the illness, he had her senses\\nperfea; no pain in the head at all, nor\\nany hivering, nor was her breath, when\\nyou came near her, so offensive as the\\nothers; but fle was melted at least half\\naway, in this very /hort time; so great was\\nthe putrefacion.\\n\\nC A S E VII.:\\n&quot;Miss Bloffac the elder, aged 7 years\\nand an half, was seized on Monday the\\nI ft Oober, in the evening with a diftafle;\\nshe had a very uneasy and tumbling night:\\nTuesday morning I was sent for by the fa-\\nmily; I found her a little feverish: I would\\nhave examined the throat, but the tongue\\nwas too much swelled (a symptom obferv-\\nable in all the reft, but more in this patient)\\nall that I could observe was, that the uvula\\nwas greatly elongated, and that the al-\\nmonds or tonsils were lightly covered with\\nlittle white spots: the little creature said,\\nshe seemed as if her mouth was full. By\\nmy advice, in consult with Mr. Boyer, fle\\nwas bled in the arm; her blood was black-\\nilh, and somewhat diflolved ; her drink was\\ncurrant or gooseberry water, which was\\ncontinued throughout the illnes. After\\nnoon the bleeding at her nole, to which\\n\\n(2&quot; lhc\\n\\nshe was very subjet, being returned, he\\nwas bled in the foot, which was again re-\\npeated in the evening, and again the Wed-\\nnefday morning. After this third bleeding\\nin the foot, we gave her a vomit, which\\ndid very well; notwithstanding, in the\\nevening we bled her again in the foot, for\\nthe 4th time, on account of a re-appearance\\nof bleeding at the nose. On Thursday\\nmorning he seemed disposed to sweat; I\\nendeavoured to make the most of it, by\\ngiving her a spoonful of aromatic water,\\nin a cup of broth: from this moment he\\nbegan to grow better and better. The\\nswelling of the tongue decreased little by\\nlittle, and the bottom of the throat seemed\\nto cleanse: the bleeding at the nose re-\\nturned, no more, insomuch that on Saturday\\nmorning I advised a soft medicine (I sup-\\npose cathartic) which however was brought\\nup again; and 1 diftinaly observed several\\npieces of membranous efchars in what came\\nup. On Sunday she began to be well,\\nthough there remained a hoarseness for five\\nor fix days, with a little fever towards\\nevening; but however a proper regimen,\\nand drinking gooseberry water, finished\\nthe cure.\\n\\n&quot; I believe the brifi bleedings, during\\nthe first days, greatly contributed to the\\ncuring this patient: however, it muff be\\n\\nallowed,\\n\\nallowed, she was not so violently seized as\\nthe others were, that he had less hidden\\nputrefation, and (plus de developement\\ndans le pouilx a more indicating pulse.\\n\\nC A SE VIII.\\n&quot; Miss Bloffac the younger, aged fix\\nyears and an half, was seized from Thurf-\\nday the 21ft in the evening, at four o&#x27;clock\\nin the afternoon, with a vomiting: J was\\ncalled the Tuesday morning, and I per-\\nceived from that moment, in pressing down\\nthe tongue, that the uvula was suddenly\\nswelled, hanging down, and that there was\\non the right almond or tonsil a white spot,\\nround the border of which was a deep red.\\nAfter having informed myself with a par-\\nticular historical detail of the two first pa-\\ntients who died, I easily apprehended the\\nexcessive danger of the disease, and in con-\\nsequence, the very little hope there was to\\nflatter one&#x27;s self with, not only from the\\nnature of the disease, but also from the ten-\\nder age of those whom it attacked, and the\\ngreat difficulty of establishing an efficacious\\nmethod of cure. I desired a consultation\\nwith Messrs. Vernage and Boyer, and we\\ndid nothing but in concert; and since that,\\non the Tuesday morning, Miss Bloffac the\\n\\nO_3 younger\\n\\nyounger had been bled in the arm, the\\nevening in the foot, the Wednesday twice\\nin the foot; we gave her a vomit, which\\ntook no effect, either upward or down-\\nward. On Thursday we reiterated the\\nbleeding in the foot: this last bleeding did\\nnot in the least dimniniih the fever; but the\\ndisease seemed every moment to be more\\nand more rapid in its progress : the emetic\\nrepeated did not a as an evacuant in the\\nleast, nor had the reiterated clyflers any\\nbetter success. The bottom of the throat\\nwas in a dreadful condition, besides that,\\nthe white spots, or aphthae, re-appeared\\nand spread themselves deeply in the bottom\\nof the throat, the edges of which were li-\\nvid, and of a violet hue: the uvula was\\nulcerated; the contagion reached the pi-\\ntuitary membrane, and the left nofiril dif-\\ncharged a clear and limpid ferofity (or\\nserum) which had not the consistence of\\npus till the 7th day of the disease. The\\nbelly remaining coflive, and yielding to no\\nremedy, fearing (with a great deal of rea-\\nson) left a fever should be fuperinduced by\\nthe stoppage of the fcccal matter, and the\\nquantity of putrefacion, already sufficient-\\nly great, should be enlarged, we ordered a\\npurge somewhat more ative, which was\\nthe root of jalap, to the quantity of twelve\\ngrains for a dose; nor indeed could I ever\\n\\npurge\\n\\npurge (for the most part) any of the deceased\\nin any other manner. This purged her two\\nor three times, and made the first evacua-\\ntion of the disease, though it was now the\\n6th day. The little success that had at-\\ntended bleeding, especially in regard to the\\ngangrenous ulcers, engaged me to apply\\nblisters to the nape of the neck, in order to\\ndraw off (if possible) that harp humour,\\nwhich corroded the almonds or tonsils.\\nThe blisters rendered the fiin red, (I fuip-\\npose inflamed the part) and took great es-\\nfed; and it appears to me, that when this\\nmethod, that is, bliffering, does not red-\\nden the skin, they are inefficacious for the\\nmost part, even though they raise blisters.\\nOn the 7th day, by the advice of Mr. Ver-\\nnage, we gave some ipecacuanna, which\\nvomited our patient, and made her dif-\\ncharge several membranes and fragments\\nof fchars: but it must be observed not-\\nwithstanding, that there did not appear\\nfewer at the bottom of the throat. In the\\nevening, every thing seemed worse and\\nworse: in this extremity they told me, that\\ncamphire had been employed in a similar\\ncafe, with success, by a phylician at Pro-\\nvence. I immediately embraced the pro-\\npolition, and the more, by reason that I was\\nstrongly induced thereto, by the example\\nof ordinary gangrenes, wherc cxperience\\n\\nQ. 4 confirms\\n\\nconfirms its usefulness. I gave her eight\\ngrains, in an ounce of oil of sweet almonds.\\nThe fever which increased, in the evening\\nseemed calmer, and lessened after she had\\ntaken the camphire, and she slept; and in\\nlieu of the ferofity that discharged from the\\nnofiril, there appeared, the next day, a be-\\nginning suppuration. I advised the repeat-\\ning the camphire twice a day; and it was\\nso till the 3oth day of the disease. Soon\\nafter the efchars were diminished, the\\ntongue unfwelled, the palate or uvula dif-\\ncharged or put off a slough, at different\\ntimes. In short, on the 20th day of the\\ndisease, I thought the patient out of, dan-\\nger: the suppuration discontinued ; he\\nblowed her nose less, and there appeared\\nnothing but a few streaks of blood, mixed\\nwith the mucus of the nose.\\n\\n&quot; But on the 24th, the fever having\\nincreasfd, I observed a tumour under the\\nright ear, and under the jaw a lonely tu-\\nmour, by itself, and separate from the pa-\\nrotid glands, painful, and of the size of a\\n]pigeon&#x27;s egg. I thenceforward looked on\\nthis tumor as critical; and in consequence,\\nthat it was proper to determine it, by all\\nforts of methods for suppuration. But the\\nparents carnefily desiring the difcuflion of\\nit, I was constrained to put upon the tu-\\nmor only greasy wool, camphire, oil, and\\n\\nlastlys\\n\\nlastly, diabotanum, which, in 15 days time,\\nentirely dissipated the tumor. It is true,\\nthat during that time, besides the camphire\\nand oil, (of which I increased or dimi-\\nnilhed the dose, as need required, and ac-\\ncording to the circumstances) I often gave\\nher a grain of Kermes-mineral, in Spanish\\nwine; ometimes purging with ipecacu-\\nanna, ometimes with jalap, ometimes\\nwith manna, &amp;c. The patient did not\\nbegin, or seem to be quite free, and out of\\ndanger, till the 45th day of the disease,\\nhaving always a pain in expressing herself,\\nspeaking through the nose, by reason of\\nthe fallen uvula. I have since been advised,\\nthat for two months together, they gave\\nher, in order to lessen the disagreeable (na-\\nzillonement) speaking through the nose, a\\nlittle camphorated brandy, with equal parts\\nof lukewarm water, to draw up (or fume)\\nher nose, and she used this remedy with\\npleasure. It is worth observing that the\\npatient was reduced to a skeleton. (D&#x27;un\\nmaigreur affrefi/J).\\n\\n&quot; Thus out of eight patients, two perilh-\\ned before their disease was known, till it was\\npat remedy. Out of the other fix, three\\ndied, quite overcome by the strength of the\\nditcafe, and three recovered.\\n\\n&quot;From the 2 ift day of the month, they\\nengaged the parents of all the children,\\n\\n7 that\\n\\nthat were thenin health, to take them\\nhome. The eldet Miss Bonac was taken\\nill of the disease at home, and was cured.\\nAll that I know of the remedies employed\\nfor her, were, blilers to the neck and legs,\\nand that he was vomited, but lofi very\\nlittle blood.\\n\\n&quot; I have since Iearned, that this patient,\\nafter the 4oth day of the disease, spoke\\nvery much through her nose, became\\nfquint-eyed, and deformed; but that as the\\ngrew itronger- ihe also regained, day by\\nday, her natural state.&quot;\\n\\nPRE-\\n\\n.[ 235 ]\\nPRE S CR I PTIONS ewhich Igenerally\\n\\nuse in COMMON FEVERS.\\nNo. I.
